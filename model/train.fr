ok that is pretty close to here theni already want to get the fuck out of this class my prof sounds so pretentious i cant stand him
i dont know he hasnt said anything about this
well isnt that nice i wonder if i can switch now
luckily there is still room in your class but i need to make sure that i wont be penalized in anyway if i drop this and enroll in your class
nevermind i can just swap
the issue i have is that i am only taking 4 courses
if i drop one then that will put me to 3 momentarily and i dont know how the faculty will see that
temporarility
but i can just swap swapping shouldnt be a problem
yes
yes i might have seen you in my lab
no it was from 1130 to 1
garzon
is there a purpose for you asking this
cant help you there yo do you know of any jobs that are not in the coop navigator that you recommend applying for
did you actually apply to all those
it takes a long time for me to apply to each position because of my ocd so i get easily tired from applying
25 is still a lot lol do you just spam resume or something
ok well i will take up on your advice i got nothing to do now anyways
which hackathon decode
hmmm i would be down for them
but i dont have much good experience in hackathon
lol
have you went to any during your first year
right i went to one as well and i made one friend who i talk to every time we are in class together
ok so why are you asking me to apply to some are there like team hacks
right
what programming language did they use in the hack you went to
ok i am all ears what do you have in mind right now
which hackathons
you know what i dont have anything planned at those times so why the hell not
have you asked any other people to join you
which ones have you signed up for so far
alright
nope i am exempted from that cpurse because i took physics before in another university
i am at site with sherry now you can come join us
we figured she wasnt gonna talk about anything that we dont know
just come join us
in the basement
ok
the one after this class
yes
95 at laurier
i am at lees now
i am not sure yet i promised some people but i am not that interested in working with them anymore
i will consider it when we start developing software i dont want to worry about it now sorry
donf know
i just did i put a lot into the essay questions
ya i had like 150word answers might as well be an essay
i am talking to chantal about it
so basically you see the figure 1 and table 1 in the prelab those are for part a so that is the misleading part
anyways i am off to work talk later
that is possibly a good idea i need to print some resume though when is it happening
ok i am not going then lol
lol so where is this happening
you need me to link me
thats why i warned you
no idea
yes i believe so
you should talk to prof me and my partner is waiting to get placed into a group
i used it a weeek or two ago wouldnt be surprised if they took it down i havent checked if i can access by the way not now
almost done
i typed a troll answer in the seg group but i got 2730 how did you do
you just had a poor undersatnding of the overall concept
or you are just not that adept at calculating stuffs yet
well if you dont study enough then it can lead to both of the things i just mentioned but anyways sorry to hear that you didnt do as well as you hoped
if you focus on the practical components of the course then maybe you can get away with not studying that much thats pretty much what i do anyways
ya taht could be a good idea i mean the more familiar you get with the concept the easier the whole thing becomes
its not like she will throw any kind of curve balls atus at us
no i dont have a study schedule because a schedule sometimes feels mindless at times
do you rigorously test your understanding of things actually that is not really a meaningful for me to ask
no that is why that question was meaningless lol
in the end you need to have some level of expectations on what are the important concepts in the course and you need to understand how they work nope havent seen it
lets talk about this after you figure out what you did wrong on the midterm if you made silly mistakes then it is something that you can easily improve
oh you already went so what kind of mistakes did you make
so what was it
ok well we cant have a concrete conversation unless you know for sure and often times the mistakes you make are unexpected but i will say that the heap was something we did for assignment 3
good that you are being diligent about it
haha sorry i didnt get the notification i think it depends on people if you are supremely confident that you can pull your grade up in the final then the grade you get now is nothing to worry about
right but that doesnt really affect your grade that much it just fucks up your schedule ultimately grade is largely affected by how well you absorb information courses by the way i am studying eco right now
just do what you gotta do you have your own way of doing things just like everybody else
nope
ya i know but i aint going maybe next week but definitely not this one
i am going to hackwestern
yes
are you going as well
oh you have received the invitation
you are gonna have to sleep on the floor and that can be tough for girls unless you book a room or have friends at western
i mean i got the same email
yes just one person
richard hayes
he is probably the most mature student in cs in our grade right now he is more diligent than i am lol
but honestly that is not saying much because i am not that diligent this semester yes and he is younger than me too lol
if i go i wouldnt study or work on school stuffs
so you are planning to go i am gonna bring my whole bed set there
ya i cant stand not getting my sleep and i am too cheap to get a motel i also have no friends in western
oh really no i mean i wont bring my mattress
i will bring my blanket and bedsheet
how are we even gonna get there
lol
i suppose
do you have the link
hey they actually got some great topics
hackwestern doesnt have really hyped up topics though
73000115000  400000  014 a
it is about as boring as you would expect
did for about 1 hour
i ainât got no data i have motion sickness whenever i do work or watch things on bus
lol i donât get that meme but thanks for the attempt lol
lol that one i got
a firstperson game is my preferance this event actually lets you make games really different from some other hackathons
thatâs not what i heard but ok
that most hackathons donât let have gaming as a theme
thanks have a good weekend
it was good my team didnt relaly make anything interesting but i learned a lot and i am hooked to going to more hackathons i say that is a pretty good outcome from my first hack
i just submitted my application to treehack i think next time i go to a hackathon i wont work on games anymore i will keep gaming to game jams kind of a waste to work on games in hackathons
did you work on assigments this whole weekend
that is too bad
for what purpose dont you already have a job for the winter
lol they had pasta that is fancy
for a career fair
nothing fancy
on the floor found an empty classroom
lol hackmit is that the one you went to before what did you make there
i was told that the environments in these hackathons are not really that different from the ones we have here in canda canada i mean they might be more prestigious on paper
hackathons
but whatever if we get in then we will go aint gonna comment on their qualities
i am gonna sign off for now to do my prelab for tomorrow fucking piece of shit
yes whats going on
nope but i watched a lot of those clips on youtube
they got some nice quotes
why
christopher nolan movies have overexaggerated actings in a lot of them
i have seen enough of the clips to know that i wont enjoy watching the entire trilogy
they are popular clips
no just the dark knight ones there are a lot of clips on youtube i noticed them before i noticed the dark knight movies
i actually liked some of his other movies interstellar inception like i watched everything he made other than the dark knight i guess i have a bias against super hero movies
lol you are asking all the right questions
i enjoyed avengers
like
the specific thing that is putting me off about dark knight is that everybody except of the main villains and heroes are badly acted and i saw that from the clips predicatble bane and joker were not
lol i actually liked his voice but those clips that i have seen did not show he had any relatable emotions
planet of the apes from 2014
well that one did suck i watched the whole thing in theatre with my friends and it had a reall shitty writing
i still remember how bad that movie was
so we just have different preferences i am ok with that i like quentin tarantino movies
and martin scorsese
ya kill bill was good
yes
what did you not like about it
his characters are often extreme people of society
i will give you that his characters are overexaggerated but that adds to the element of dark comedy that most of his movies are based around and i absolutely love dark comedy
and chris waltz
like if those crazy characters existed in real life then those actors nailed them and that is why i enjoy his films anyways i havent seen michael bbays films so i cant comment on his trash films
i am gonna sleep now so see you tomorrow in the lab
just leave the class
how do you check
i am yellow
i have no clue girl
nothing i am not sure when we will setup the game jam maybe it wont happen despite all the promises we made at the beginning of the year
no havenât been to class in a while
ok thanks for letting me know but the final is not gonna happen for a while
i donât renember
nope but i went to the lab
ok
ya i ainât going to class no more
i never pay attention in her class actually this is true for all of my classes
i go to some for attendances but the lectures are truly waste of time for me
i ainât going yiu can go have fun there if yiu wang
lol has he ever take attendance
there is no point in the attendance he canât use it as a marking
it is worthless
if it is going to help you then go ahead and take those bonuses but it is not that useful for me
yes
maybe
sorry i am working on seg now
its cool we will talk about it after this whole shits over
you too
well i understand the concept since i learned it in tutorial
is there a reason why you asked
lol why not you are like rejecting all of these great hackathons
thats fair
but ubc hack
around 900 round trip
and the plane ride isnt very good
i have travelled to vancouver before and i always hated the plane ride
cant sleep small space lack of free space
actually that is true for all plane ride
the coach ride was good though thats the only kind of ride i like anyways i also just applied to uottawahack
yes those
not yet
guess i will look at it tomorrow
why would you go to a hardware hack
i am doing yellow
you bet
done everything except a few that are probably going to be taken out
the answers seem outright wrong so i believe they will be taken out
yes
yes
i am not using the cheat sheet
i didnât know there was a second one
i didnât know state diagram can have activity
well i would imagine it is just a task that can be performed according to the information on the state diagram
i donât know i am working on csi assignment
didnt have to well i did but i did it implicitly in my head i didnt include it in my answer
nope gonan study that tomorrow
chapter 6
my plan is just read over the lecture slides and make sure i get some practice for the writing component tof the eam yes istudying for this exam is not hard
no i meant the studying is straight forward
well my understanding is that in a broker architecture there is a class a that has access to the broker and the broker has access to another class b
aint a thang
what do you not undersatnd about it
this example does a bad job showing it in a more realistic example you would have many observers not just one
and in order for them to respond to a phenomenon they would all have to interact with each other which requires a lot of dependencies
you have the observers only connect to the lone observable and have the observable tell them when things happen by having them connect to a lone observable rather than to each other that reduces dependencies
well that is a minor reason for reducing dependencies reducing dependencies is mostly for improving maintainability of code
and ease of use
happy birthday girl
tyty you are far too kind
nope thatâs the one i applied late for i am probably not gonna get in
exammark is that like an instance variable nah i havent
ciena where is yours
this is the first time i heard abbout it
pretty sure this is the first time you told me about it at least on fb you briefly mentioned to me before that you didnt apply for any jobs this semester
vatican lol you would go that far huh
if they cover my expense then yes
so you were so desperate to avoid your classmates that you opted to do coop during summer huh thats a nice strategy i get where you are coming from
oh ok i thought for sure that was the reason
well no but i am talking about some incredibly obnoxious people in our program there are friendly classmates but there are also some really smart ass individuals that i simply do not want to ever interact with
right arrogant was the word i was looking for
ya
it is pretty useful though so i muted it instead of removing myself
i am from toronto
north york so the uptown area so are you gonna tell me what is the real reason why you didnt want to do winter coop you wanted more experience and be competitive in the next job app cycle
oh really
for what reason i think austin is also considering switching
ya the coop program here doesnt offer many interesting companies
pretty bland stuff
but i do feel that the certificate of engineering is worth it yes i will
the problem is i spend all of my time doing game development but nothing in any of the more mainstream stuffs
ya that is what i hope to do i gotta work hard to get a good looking demo
pc and mac
ya i grew up doing desktop and laptop nothing on console except of pokemon
i played pokemon it was good old times but now i play games that are really heavy on plot
still ahvent seen it yet but i got in uoft hackearth oh wait i am not entirely sure i think they only just sent some links to test my skill apparently
ya actually i think i am in since it says i am registered in it
how do you check
already did
it just says i am registered and there are over 1000 students registered so far
probably
if i am going i will go by car i got my own
i can take you along with me if we are both going
only first day very boring
exactly
thanks
30 minutes usually
how do you rsvp
didnt get that email but that is actually pretty soon
i will do it later if i dont get in then that is that
i havent gotten that rsvp thing so likely i am not going assume that i havent gotten it
i think i applied everywhere and they are still looking at applications
i donât know what that is
probably applied
neither have i so i guess we got rejected or simply that i am not good enough both reasons are understandable
yo we got a message from uottawa that a student died in the university you know who that is
ya a message from the president of uottawa
an email sorry
you sent a photo
ya today just a few minutes ago
yo you got in uottahack
why not
to another hack
ahh right reading week well that is too bad you booked tickets real early
when is that happening
ok i will apply later
good
it is very relaxing and they dont give a shit how long it takes for me to complete simple tasks at least for now how is school life
ya i drink free hot chocolate there everyday
not free food but they got all kinds of gourmet drinks for free espresso mokaccino you name it
network management software mostly the software is built on the back of intellij java
restful api user interface ya pretty much
have you started looking for a jobb for summer yet
whats your dream internship right now google
then thats what you gotta do you should read into machine learning
thats the thing right now
everybody will hire you if you have worked with it
i am reading about it
i wanna do something machine learning related for the uottahack
well i overexaggerated but there are some incredibly high paying jobs if you know that skill nope i might work alone
one additional person at most
ya for sure
no but i thought it is a good motivation for a lot of people
but the thing is i was inspired recently that machine learning will solve ai
like it is the most dominant form of ai currently and that is a good motivation for me to learn
thats ok
i can learn that
yup that is very true
you are welcome and thank you for motivating me to go to hackathons
physical barrier is a real thing
oh you meant for jobs ya that is true it certainly takes people out of their comfort zone
no i meant for hackathon but they are still the same honestly
maybe less hindering for hackathon
yes
at uoft or on uottawa
most places i know close over night
well i still dont know a good place to sleep
ooooh i see i was completely missing your point i still dont know jack though
yo are you going to hack the valley i got accepted
ok
go ahead
well i got rejected from uoft and waterloo i didnt choose ubc because i was in ubc prior to getting into uottawa and i felt like i stayed there long enough
i always wanted to switch over to computer tech related field because i was always good at programming and i imagined that was where my future lied in
quite a bit i was doing programming for 3 years in high school and 1 year at uoft and those were my most enjoyable courses
well they got many of them you can find them on their calendar
csc148 thatâs the one
holy
since when did you go
so they are having another hack in a few weeks that is really weird is this the scarborough campus that you went to
so tell me what was incredible
well that is typically the case to have a proper team
i am curious though so the one you went to a few days ago was also the hack the valley and they are having another hack the valley in scarborough
what was it called i dont think i applied to that one
i dont think i applied to that one goddamn was that also 500 people
and honestly the campus itself is not that pretty except of the bahan building it is old and unfriendly
i won uofts first starcraft 2 tournament in bahan that building holds a lot of good memories for me
no it is mostly a computer science building engineering building is the one across the street galbraith and sandford fleming
like i said mostly
that is not the right time more like 15min
oh you were weak
damn girl you were practically a mule
ya it is but if you ride it enough you will know it is shit
definitely better than ottawa for sure
you should try autodesk that is one of the most prestigious tech companies in downtown toronto
yes in a very elegant building
yes
it was great keeping it cool with my colleagues how is school
yeah oh i didnât know you sent one
i will do it after i get back home
dude you tell me to use linkedin more often but you dont even have a photo for your account
i did 2021
i dont know it doesnt matter that much
boring as fuck i have been leaving early quite often this week
how are you girl
lol that sounds like a let down
so she was trying to recruit you or something or what is this
did you tell them that you are looking for the type of opportunity that they are trying to fill
what did they say to that
lol
thats awesome hopefully she meant that
i hope something comes out of it for you
especially sine nyc
oh
always worth a shot
httpsiimgflipcom1539xxjpg
what does that metaphor mean
you bet your ass you will yo i am gonna go to sleep now
good night
4012 is peng around
thats too bad
please send my regards to him i already did
ya all of us are beginners
well exploring is a great way to build objectives i am not trying to make a successful run in this hackathon just trying to expose myself to as much as possible
hackathon is a good learning environment and i didnât come here entirely to learn i also came to socialize
good for you
it was the best one i had in terms of the substantiality of the product my team made
ya i do know someone are you looking for summer
i think they already selected the people have they not coop selections just recently finished and the guy i know just came to talk to me about this like 2 weeks ago that they already selected
kanata office if you are looking for other offices i can ask the person that i know if they are still hiring but i only directly know people from my own office
ok
so the person that i know told me to tell you to contact sophia rosenberg her email is sophiarocienacom she is the recruiter for interns i believe
what is it
possibly tomorrow or tonight should have asked me earlier lol
are you living on campus like i would still be down
hmm of
ok i can check if there are still any left i can drive there
is this like cineplex or what is this regular format you know what forget it i ainât going maybe next time
ya sure thanks for asking
sorry didnât see your messafw i ainât into marvel movies but whenever i hear good stuffs about them i would try to watch it on the other hand you seem to be quite interested in comic book materials
how was black panther by the way
yo thanks for letting me know i havent thought too far up that level yet but those are certainly good places how are you doing these days
i am relaxing for the weekend but relaxing as in working on my personal projects lol
where have you searched so far i am working on the same game that i have been working on since december
that is kind of weird huh oh wait it is not because other people already have summer positions
it is competitive
any luck so far
was it also this tough to find jobs last summer why not go back to the same place
lol what do you wanna do then
web dev is actually a pretty good skill to have whats wrong with web dev thogh
man i wish i had front end skill i have none of that right now after my next coop i am going to need some mad front end skill to start my new project
yews eithre i learn it myself or i get somebody else to do it preferably somebody else
anyways i hope you can replicate the same success that you achieved last summer but looking for jobs right now for summer is always tough business there are people out there who are still looking but it is tough
thanks i also just gotta keep going at it but i set a deadline for myself before end of august or somebody else has to take over the project
i had it open source for a while but i switched over to a private repository a while ago but i also recruited a few individuals to help me with the project that is probably enough
ya sure i can do it whenever
lol lets see what you got
you actually did a pretty good job with the content you have so far
but very competitive resumes typically have more content
i dont think taht makes much of a difference
but regardless that is not something that is important in my opinion and the important thing is actually the lack of content did you volunteer in anyway for uottahack
should put that in the resume
you can leave that in there
instead reduce the space the other content takes
keep that in there you should keep everything you have so far in there but reduce the amount of space for some of them the first thing yo ucan try is reducing the font size maybe
put that award with the mcmaster competition dont need two sections to describe one thing
if you won it then you gotta mention it what did you do for uottahack exactly anything above 8 is worthy to be on the resume collaborated with teammates in order to engineer a stable load bearing mechanism
well collaborated sounds weaker than engineered you should be highlighting the fact you engineered something not that you collaborated with people
engineered more important
yes but i am telling you to give more weight to your skill than your ability to collaborate
anybody can collaborate but not everybody has strong skills
what do you mean by specific scenario
it should be the case for any scenario where people value skill more than collaboration
and what exactly does this stable load bearing mechanism do you need to expand on that did you have any sort of application to this like did it manage to bear like 10t of weight
if you won the competition then it must have done something that other people were not able to do right
you gotta put that in there and put the number of teams too
it is actually pretty amazing what you did
did you win anything or is this just for bragging rights
mention how much scholarship you would have won but say it like won xxxx as if you actually won it
yes so what about this tech conference
well you should say planned and proposed a budget to xxxx
that is over simplified but follow that skeleton
welcome i am thinking if there is anything else that you modify yelp for bathrooms android app â uoft hacks v university of toronto merge them into one line and remove the name for your app
yes
absolutely remove redundant information
ya you gotta go in detail in it i only gave you a skeleton
but the general idea is to show that you did a lot of work and that without your contribution then the event wouldnt be the same
yes
well have you submitted yet you need a better reason than you want a job
ya i know but i mentioned this in case you have no good answer
oh this is for hardware
get creative
ok
i am curious why you removed the mcmaster scholarship or the competition
doesnât fit the other content of resume like you donât want to put anything unrelated to soft eng
ohhhh physically doesnât fit the space
you can save at least 3 lines the way i see it now
all the titles of the things you did can be merged into one line
yes
and if i were you i would write the descriptions more concisely
it just can be shortened express the same idea in less words
i can help you later but i canât now
worked with a team to engineer a prototype of an android application which helps users find public accessible bathrooms based on their current location  prototyped an android application that helps users find nearby public bathrooms
you should actually take some udemy courses courses that you will enjoy and will be useful and start a personal project
very cheap if you go online and check now you might find some good deals just look for what you are interested in
coursera also makes you pay
ok
pretty good how about you
ya cant wait to go back to school
ya i learned everything that i wanted to learn here in ciena there is no point in me being here any longer
nope i already found my next job
ya really
but i will still be in coop program
the things that i learned at ciena are not anything technical but more the environment
so i wouldnt have learned anything like that from taking courses
anyways i am going to work at honda research institute next starting september
8 months
yes
i will be helping a researcher the guy is doing something related to humancomputer interaction specifically in human eye behavior
so i am going to help him setup experimental simulation using unity and collect and analyze data using machine learning techniques
on a different level
ya it is very research based i have a bit of a reservation about it
it definitely is not
tokyo japan
ya its gonna be an interesting 8 month not many people gets to work at japan
i didnt go that far honestly
this job was listed in the canadajapan coop program thats how i got in
i think it would be have been much tougher to get a job that is not sanctioned by any organizations here in canada oh who is your friend
as a student at least if i graduate that is a different story
you gotta look for opportunities constantly and be confident about it i think people in the university relies too heavily on the university to help them find a position i used to be like that too
it sounds like you are bitter about the people in our program lol that has been what you sounded like since we first chatted
i would advise you to focus on yourself
what they do is their own business
i think i would hate people too but only if they complain about the consequence of doing bare minimum like bring it up to my face about it otherwise good luck to you ð and have fun too
just explore as much as you can i guess aint no way around it by the way did you see wei hus statement for getting into the faculty council we had that a few weeks ago
there was this faculty council that should have happened already that students from our school were vying to be elected into
students who get elected get the opportunity to talk to the top brass of the faculty of engineering to give advice on what should be improved education wise program wise
well he basically complained about him being paid less than minimum wage job and then he also mentioned he had like 997 gpa
i dont think he actually intended to send out this kind of message but what i got from that is he is complaining about a minimum wage job when he hadnt done anything to deserve a higher paying job
like 997gpa doesnt really mean anything
no everybody got an email for this
search for faculty liam peyton  he is also desperately looking for extracurriculars to put on his resume he mentioned on the statement lol
in the end he got elected good for him but like that was one of the most selfentitled thing that i read about one of the students in our program
there is still hope in this program lol i am gonna singlehandedly bring glory to our program after i come back from japan
a podcast lol
oh ya it sounds cool
ya we are in a shit education system thats for sure if nobody changes this system in the next 10 years somebody will overthrow it
haha what irony and many people share your sentiment and there are many analogous problems in the business world too because people are focusing more on making money than creating values
it is truly a pitiable state of affair
i dont agree with that but an organization can aim for a perfect harmony of business and value creation they are not mutually exclusive
it is not easy but doable
thanks i will look into it
lol did you make this
lol when was this made two years ago yo you wrote a coop report this past summer right
isnt it mandatory to write a report
i see
aint a problem
2500 words but i will probably write more
sure it can be a good learning experience for you but the types of things i will mention can only be learns from experiencing them first hand
i donât ever maybe i should though did you learn a lot from them
i actually saw the blog for my own company because i was doing some research and they were talking about adaptive network i think they had a blog on that too
lol i am not into nonprofit but money is not my primary concern
it is great to read up on these things because they are interesting but ultimately they donât really help you to be more productive unfortunately
haha i see i didnât know you meant reading when you have a moment to spare
ya they take care of housing and airplane tickets but the salary is pretty bad though i wouldnât have taken this opportunity if it wasnât for the fact that it is in japan ð
ya i am gonna travel a lot too in japan i applied for an international experience scholarship just for this hopefully i get it getting that would let me do more things in japan
like the back alley of the city
it is in general there are lots of nontourism locations in japan that are worth going to just walking on the street is one of them and maybe nintendo headquarter tokyo u is also a worthy location
lol are you still into pokemon
as in you have the latest pokemon game
what do you mean probably you either have it or you dont
is your place university
whatâs the rent and utility
well i dont know anybody off the top of my head but i will keep it in mind
yes
yes you gonna read some
well neither do i you got to stare at that paper until it makes sense to you thats about the only thing you can do
or you can take some machine learning courses to broaden your knowledge
the latter is typically slower but that is what most people do
theoretically you can google while you read but that gets on everybodys nerve because people dont have a high level of concentration to do that
ya do that did you manage to find a job for summer
its not like i care about whether you get a job ok you probably wouldnt understand that reference
it is a trope in anime called tsundere you can google that
i dont consciously hide it or anything
by the way i have been thinking about reading some papers too just yesterday after getting inspired by an anime but i was thinking more about cancer papers
things that are more clinically relevant
i think i wouldnt be satisfied being ordered around by people i would rather make my own company like at this point i would be legitimately sad if i dont get to run my own company
good for you
haha ya i sure as hell am thanks for remembering that i am going to honda lol i get a feeling that not many people remember that i even dont think my close friends remember it
it will definitely be fun i gotta get my japanese up to speed this summer
by the way you finished with your exams and why are you subletting your place for the summer
you will be moving back to your parents right
unless you get the job
going back home to study on your own is not a terrible idea though even if you have nobody to sublet to or just stay there and study on your own
ya that was a bad advice but wouldnt it be kind of late now to enroll in courses
ya thats right that is considered 2 coops
why
i mean whats the problem with that in the end you do like 20 months of coop
what
yes so what is wrong with that whats ur problem
i dont know what ur problem is
i am paying too this summer surprisingly i dont know why i thought they mentioned that you only have to pay when you are in the coop term or something
one of them i mean why dont you just get out of coop
i thought you switched
then why dont you switch out lol the switch request must be made soon or the deadline has already past and they will switch you out in middle of may
ok well you got to make the choice girl and as for software
i honestly dont think they would disqualify you for such a trivial detail are you still talking about coop internships or internships in general
i mean at our level i dont think they will disqualify you like that especially when it comes to general and science degree is a technical field is it not
so what are you scared about
you getting cold feet cuz you got to make a decision
haha i see i felt that too truly though software engineering will fare better than pure computer scientists in the long term
it is only a slight advantage
my mindset about this whole thing is like this
right now you dont know jackshit about what is going to happen in the future
5 years down the line you might think to yourself man i wish i had done software eng instead it is a degree that will open up slightly more opportunities in the future
honestly if that is all you want then cs will be better
because i am looking at the long term 30 years down the line not just the next five having training in software eng might help me get funds from government small advantages that most people dont care about
running personal projects
possibly
lemme put it this way if i am an incredibly practical individual i would have pursued cs over soft eng but i am not a practical man i like to take advantages of any small advantages i have
and i dont ever want to reach a point in my life where i think back to myself that i wish i had done soft eng i dont want any regrets
i mean i might never ever get a chance to flex that soft eng degree but i can accept that at least i gave it my all and know that i didnt miss anything
ya you absolutely should chill out enjoy life for a bit when you come back you might have a different perspective but lemme tell you this though
you bet your ass i did
who is your brother anyways i wanted to ask
ya what does he study and what does he do now
his suggestion is understandable coming from him
but he can certainly be biased since he is doing engineering himself that is like not a masters that is like phd unless he worked for a few years in the industry before going to graduate study
i am pretty sure he is biased because having an engineering degree for mechanical is totally different story than having an engineering in software
i am working all week next week and going back to toronto on friday for the weekend like what is your plan for summer will you be here like on may 1
ok i will make time for you on may 1 but honestly it all comes down to whether you decide to stay in software or compsci
science of what
the more i talk with you the more it sounds like you dont know what you wanna do lol
we will talk in detail in may 1 on
way faster to communicate in person
ya
ya it is truly a simple selection of choices but you need to make the decision that you can be responsible for and not be swayed by a third party
well yes
well it is certainly not too late to realize that now things might not be so rosy for you right now since you only recently came out of that realization but it is never too late
good for you you got lots of hope left dont worry and making mistakes to explore your options is not a bad thing mistakes is frowned upon by most people but they dont realize how useful it is
it honestly aint i can guarantee you that
aint a problem you need to cool down for a bit and think clearly
good first step
almost i am sure i will finish this weekend i actually met sherry on wednesday cuz her company is next door and she hasnt started when i asked her then
to be fair i start things early precisely because i am unable to do things within a day or two my low attention span wouldnt allow it
yo you still down for meeting next tuesday if you are i thought maybe we can go watch infinity warfare
aaaaww hell naww but yo when are we meeting on tuesday can you meet after 1230
we can meet before 1120am if you are free i mean first of all do you still need advice or are you over with your crisis thatâs the only reason why i am offering you this meeting
so meet or no meet
ok let me know when you need to talk
ok in a bit
you sent an attachment
lol where are they available
do i have to book the ticket now or do you think there will be enough seats to buy the ticket there and what time are you thinking about
so i go to the theatre at 830
can you show me the site decide the venue and show me where i can get the ticket
sure
this stuff took 10 years to make
so 830 today
yo there aint no more available seats nvm
doing it now ainnt no problem
i got a car
i might be able to pick you up or drop you off if it is on my way
i am at gatineau where is your place

ok i will pick you up it is in fact exactly on my way i can come get you at like 750 or earlier if you want to get a better eat seat
alright then i will come get you at like 730 we will be at the theatre before 750 but we got time to talk and stuff
did you manage to buy it
lol do you want me to buy it for you you can pay me in cash when we meet
alright i will get it for ya ok i got you
canât you pay me when you hop on my car or you wanna make sure that i did indeed buy you a ticket before you pay me
jesus christ
wait i will give you 1150 and then you give me 20 thats cool
i didnât know that it might be nice if that is the case
is that something that you have to request
lets talk about this later
i am right next to your house supposedly
i am right next to the laundry house
yes 425
i am sitting on the second row from front
its cool
oh ya good for you i am as well
i am in adm1100
ya sure i could do it
i enlisted paristoo and amar in the business class so we got four now
he had just enough lines i wish peter quill didnât go full retard when he was fighting thanos on titan
him punching thanos when he was sleeping was like the stupidest shit i have seen in a really long time
nah fuck that thanos had plot armour there
ya it was his first appearance was badass when he was in the dark catching that lance like berserker from fate
ya sorry that is something you wouldnt know but berserker was known for catching other peoples weapons
too busy to help you now
hahaha thatâs the attitude you got any ideas
i wanna start making an universal knowledge ai
we will start small i wanna use an ai to help scientists answer detailed questions
ya i will do this after i come back from japan hopefully i will have the expertise to make it a reality after my work in japan
i want to live my life in japan aint gonna have time to do capstone project while i am there
you mean on pokemon go i ainât a pokemon fan no more there are a few seasonal places that i need to go when i immediately arrive there
lol that sure would bring back memories wouldnât it
lol i will see if i have time
no i most likely wont but i think they will require formal attire the first day but i certainly wouldnt want to wear formal stuff everyday
lol you are like the second person who does that it takes some serious confidence to not wear what everybody else wears
this guy called jonathan gratton he is in cs and he is also doing his second degree he also tried graduate study for like a few days and then immediately dropped out and went back to undergrad in cs
no he is in cs he actually kind of looks down on people in seg i dont remember which graduate school maybe uottawa oh he was in graduate school for physics for a couple of days
well he is supremely confident that the extra iron ring doesnt do jack shit and he looks down on softies for believing that the iron ring does shit his stereotypical perception of their behavior
it is arguable he is young like we all are and we dont know whether the ring can do anything for you until it is actually helpful
ya we are actually
can you list out those guys who sees themselves are more superior i am interested
i think i know who yo uare talkinga bout he kind of has a high voice
haneen is that girl who is always wearing that religious garment thingy
yes i dont know who mac is but i thought austin is switching to cs
what about them makes you feel that they think they are superior
can you give me an example to be honest the only impressions i have of them is they are keeners and they are extremely confident individuals
lol ya i remember that
who is lee
this short asian kid in se with high gpa talks a lot about his gpa and his accomplishments
well nothing significant but he was talking about what he did in his past coops and how he can get a coop job as a full stack developer during his conversations with his friends
i forgot
but one of his gpa accomplishment was bragging to people how he got like 94gpa even after getting a d or c in one of his classes i believe it was technical writing
i know before i talked to you about this and i was pretty negative about these people
but at the end of the day i think it is kind of overly stereotyping to stop our observations about these individuals at the surface level i think if we chat with them enough we can probably better understand them and not think of them as simply arrogant
like i used to think that wei is also an arrogant individual but he is more than just a confident person once you speak with him and that is what i did
he was the only serious guy huh
he was trying to make other people in seg switch to csi
i talked to him near the end of the coop term through fb
this stuff is complicated but at the end of the day you should choose your degree for logical reasons not because you dont think the things you are learning are unimportant that is naive i would say
and i will leave it at that i seriously need to get back to work
thanks
no game dev talk alter
yo whatâs up
is that for the lab or project
i donât have an partner for assignment a
lol what
osts made by sawano hiroyuki so am i good enough to be your partner for assignment or do you consider me too weak
just for the assignment i already got teammates for project and ya it is from animes ost stands for original sound track
donât worry you donât need to enjoy anime to enjoy his music
what are you doing up so late
i just did wtf is this
he is just stereotyping the shit out of black people sorry i donât listen to many american pop songs i have a very stereotypical view of things
i understand
i will check it out in a bit
i am in vancouver with 3 hour time lag i am gonna have to listen to the songs tomorrow donât have a headset with me now in bed other people are sleeping
ubc gotta train my ass in japanese culture before i go to japan
arigatou joydeepchan i am gonna sleep now keep me updated with seg3125 if you can
alright
it has been fruitful in my opinion it is a good thing that i get to meet with my fellow classmates and getting to hear the experience of alumni of this program
i am talking only about other people who are going to japan
you ó°
haha ainât that nice vanc is good too
amar paraistoo bijan me and you bijan might change
what do you like about the two songs you sent me for the first son the best character was that guy who was narrating the opening scene and flexing his muscles
you liked everything because you watched the movie but the music is indeed good
i am still in vancouver
gotta take the airplane right now
ok i can help edit i watched black panther on the airplane by the way now i feel it is overrated the black antagonist did a lot of things that seemed to purposefully inflammatory
there were a few scenes where he claimed he was going to save blacks from their oppressors by giving them vibranium his mentality of wanting to save the blacks didnât really fit his character
he never should have became king in the first place too the council should have recognized that he was way too petty for a king
lol you just accept my explanation like that ok i did write cover letters before you wanna mention your motivations for wanting to work for them and why you are the best person to be hired
i have github and a page to demo my game
yes
no here is a cover letter i used to get an interview you sent an attachment
yorokonde
it means âwith pleasureâ ð
yo what lecture slide are we on for all of our classes
ok thanks ð
yo can you run me through what we need to do for quality assurance tutorial and lab
oh shieeeeeet well its ok i think i got a good handle on it after reading some docs
it wasnt much help for me but for others it could be useful in fact i felt like they made us more scared of the japanese culture than necessary
for example they told us to be humble in front of the japanese if you dont then we would make a fool of ourselves but that is assuming the japanese doesnt have different expectations from foreigners
well they sort of did but they needed to be a bit more flexible with their mindsets i only realized about this issue after talking to somebody living in japan right now after coming back from training
ya it costed me like 250
well you know what this is part of the price to pay and i got tons of scholarships recently so i aint all that worried about this to be honest how are you doing these days
you sure enjoy walking last time you were walking in the middle of the night like who does that
you feel stressed out sometimes just gotta let go
i havenât looked at it i will look over it tonight and will let you know
have you tried sansotei
that is asian
i donât know any unfortunately
i went there once one of the better ramen places iâve been to
there are few in toronto they are all about the same why you asking looking for a place to eat with friends
maybe hong kong express right across metro chinese fast food
those chinese fast food places are in general pretty good as far as taste goes but they tend to be heavy in oil and calorie
very pleasant ð
lol why are you asking me you probably know better than i do i donât do bubble tea
but if you do go please do let me know what you have i am quite interested in what you get
so what did you end up doing got your bubble tea
lol i couldnt really tell for some of them because his voice sounded similar to those characters his actual voice i meant
did it taste like red bean
lol i guess dont go to the same place again
i actually dont yet if you want we can form a group
no i dont
i just aint that interested in all these western craps ya i heard too
if you want to see how crap a film is star wars will disappoint if you want how crap something is see the room
no the room is pretty much considered one of the worst films in existence like other films like star wars can be entertaining with its actions or fancy spectacles but this one just has little to no merit whatsoever
you watch so many movies
what is that supposed to mean
yo you got an idea for what website we wanna use for 3125 assignment 1
tomorrow morning
if you want we can do steam which is a game shopping platform
you sent a photo
ya
ignore the unity courses those are from something else
it is alright nothing wrong with mine
now the hard part is learning how to use it
it specified that it should be separate
yes that is right but it is specified as separate so you need to make it separate
yes i am planning to make the first screen contain everything other than the summary
it will certainly be tedious
looking for it online right now got no luck i am honestly thinking about buying this book right now but i will wait
i am gonna get it on kindle for 50 nowadays thats pretty much where i keep all my books i dont buy paper no more how about you
haha watch that language
where did you learn to swear like that i need to know please tell me
haha your brother huh
he and i might get along
did you guys both go to like really sweary high school
your parents wouldnt have an effect on it
i dont swear as much as i used to because i grew up from xxx that bitch there are more artistic way of using those words in my opinion
and i say a lot of nigger with my friends like samuel l jackson
lol as in the n word
who dat nigger up on dat nag i mostly learnt it from watching too much tarantino
you mean you didnt learn it like that
you sent an attachment
aint a thing homes
lol lets stop here
i dont wanna get into that habit
maybe you can try talking to others
only one way to find out
well i think you could be as well i concur
heheyee boiii
i havent done anything with it so i wouldnt know
no lots of stuffs going on in my mind
not yet
no we got class very soon 1130 ui design
we already made our decision about the topic to choose so dont worry about it
just know that we chose topic 3 with the social media data
it aint a big deal but make sure to contribute in the future
what time are you available can we do the evaluation tomorrow is that possible if not i can do friday morning or something
you make your idea sound so intriguing
you ó°
yo how is the search for people going you still need someone
in the morning
between 9  1120am
you get him girl
oh hell yes
yes i think so but it is not absolutely necessary there are plenty of places in crx i will look into this after i eat
but do you know how to book if you know can you book
thanks
oh hell ya we going to town on friday
actually lemme type out a list of things we are gonna ask our subjects to do
you need to familiarize yourself with steam before we do this
can you make the doc i will put the content in there
yo
you donât need to install nothing
we gonna do it on the web
fwang100uottawaca lol we truly gangster niggers now
by the way the login information for the steam account is testsubject12314 password seg3125z00
ya you can use it too
oh shiet whatever yo i updated the google doc so the only things we need now are consent forms
and after seg3103 tomorrow we need to group up together to discuss exactly what is going to happen during the evaluation are you in seg3103
so that means 1130
ummeet at 12pm at louispasteur no wait crx
5th floor all the way left of elevator by the way what do you got that is so urgent
i am just curious
for another class
oh career advice i see
by the way its not like i am interested in your life or anything like that ok
anyways be there see you
too late for the joke
yo i am at crx if you wanna talk and get this shit over with you can come now
i said 12 before but if you actually wanna come at 12 i can wait but if you got nothing to do now come over and letâs take care of this the assignment i mean
just turn left after getting off elevator and you will see me
left
it was the best fucking sub i ever had in my life
arent you meeting somebody
i see
you dont need anybodys advice but mine sweet heart
what did you learn
she worked at all these great places huh what is she doing now
never heard about that company before
its like a news webpage
well i guess good for her for getting there
dude i forgot to print the consent form lol and i just overslept so hard i will do my best to do things quickly but more than likely i will be late
chelsea is already here get your ass here asap
taking notes
no i am already driving back to toronto
well i donât think i am gonna see any subway on the route today
lol why is toronto called that i am back though
why
i aint all that big on the cookies
i have enough carbs for the next two days
yo how do you want the report to be written i can review the video files and write down the steps each subjects took to complete the tasks but what are we gonna do for malfunctions
ok
we will go with what we have then but we will have to make up some malfunctions thatâs the only way
the only way we can come up with lots of malfunctions is if the website is complete trash software is complete trash
do you still have seg2105 project we can use that
yes or we can use blender blender is one of the least user friendly software out there
ya you can be
download it onto your computer your first task is scaling the cube at the beginning by 2
but yo
are we sure we canât come up with anything no malfunction
so do we only need four malfunctions
we can say that the ui has too much in it
opening page has tons of ads for other games letâs say it scared my mom away
and letâs say there is no button to directly go into a search page one way to go to a search page is just press enter in the search box in an empty search box that is highly unintuitive
it actually has it
you type something in a search box and there is no drop down
hmmm ok so that is already 3 its not very hard see
yes
yes
lemme tell you though i wouldnât waste too much time on this assignment donât think too much about the requirements we should just complete it as reasonably possible
give me some time to contemplate about other things and then i will join you
i just got the perfect seg3125 idea
physics test chamber
a video game test chamber that allows students of physics to visualize movements of objects in a realistic environment
desktop
um no purely seg3125
it scares people away and make them lose attention
it is the same principal as seeing an assignment pdf full of texts and complicated terminologies and the next moment you find yourself watching youtube videos this happens very frequently when you have very low motivation
you know in that sense education is practically a very fucked up user interface
good my family had lunch with my fatherâs former classmates in china they are from edmonton and they had three very beautiful daughterð
asian legend have you heard about it
well it is a popular chinese restaurant chain here in gta
lol that is a big question i aint got no answer for that because it is not designed to be enjoyed
it is designed to cram peoples head with information and make people get high gpa whether we enjoy it is the least of most educators concern
ye
who are they by the way
who the fuck is liam peyton what did you have him in
better be good
shawn janssen
lemme check
lol i cant find him for some reason sjanssencienacom

ok
what do you mean closed
ok
ya that seems to be the only way to be honest it is unknown how much you can get from this but it is certainly worth a shot
what conference is this
oh thats the one you mentioned in your resume yo i will talk to you later girl i am about to meet up with my friends and i gotta get ready
main screen
just follow what you did for seg2105
well ya it is kind of tough at the beginning but you get used to it after a while
can you work on the malfunction list for the assignment i will take care of the pseudo code thing once i take care of the pseudo codes i can assist you in the malfunction description
yes that is certainly a malfunction i think you got plenty of malfunctions that is good i will work on my part now dude you didnt have to write the summary
would it be ok for you if i just read over your existing malfunctions and choose the ones that suit us but regardless lemme convert one of them to a watchable format
but you should still check over the video i sent you
it is in mp4 format is it not
cant you watch mp4 with any kind of video player
you probably cant watch it on g drive
ok great
i am gonna be signing off for the night might come back later to check on your work
yes i do but they are practically the same thing minor differences were described in my transcript you wanna watch his video too
alright i will convert now
when she typed portal in the search box you can hear her pressing enter but the search bar did not go away sorry the search suggestions didnt go away
welcome sweet heart also just sent the 2nd video
they were gauging my motivation mostly
they asked me about my past projects and the interviewer who i took the offer from asked me my interest in science
ya 5 in total
to be honest they were all around the same they didnt ask any problem solving questions
yes
i dont mean this in any rude way but may i ask why you are so curious about my experience
oh ok well i canât offer you any advice unfortunately ð but i should have realized it from the content of your questions so what is this interview for
which company and i would disagree with you on not memorizing algorithms knowledge is creativity and creativity separates normal people from geniuses
well i just explained why you should memorize things memorization gives you knowledge that you can utilize in cases that need them
sorry when i said memorize algorithms i meant memorize and understand them of course there is no point in just memorizing steps in an algorithms
i submitted the proposal but i havenât programmed nothing
lol who is christine chern do you know this person
which group
lol i see it sure is a problem that people on linkedin flirting with them sarcasms aside and i understand taht this is a controversial issue but these girls are over sensitive
lol i was sarcastic
the reality of the situation is that dating is a competitive market it is slightly unprofessional to be making moves on people in a career setting but sometimes it is a convenient and highquality source for dating
if guys were hit on linkedin or in workplace you wouldnt see them complaining about it they would gently refuse the approach and not make a big fuss
ya absolutely it is i mean believe it or not but dating is just as competitive ive been there
if i find a pretty girl in japan in my workplace you can bet your ass that i will try to approach her
well we all are
sorry what
ok you meant like people around us you know some people who are looking
oh ok
yo by the way can you explain to me this girls mindset
like it is so common for girls to be creeped or grossed out by these kinds of things and i always had the impression that it is because girls are in general more vulnerable than boys
am i right in assuming that
she is explicitly complaining about this random guy adding her randomly like i get so many random people adding me too every fucking day on linkedin but i never had a problem with that
ya so that is why i think she was creeped out by it
and people who commented on that post was also lamenting how linkedin is used for dating
i just wanted to confirm my thinking it is unfortunately this type of attitude amongst the girls that makes so many introverted guys have a hard time approaching girls lol i feel like i am complaining about my life
it is hard to classify people into discrete categories it is typically a mix
but i would say you might be extroverted with some traits of introverts
thats a good thing
oh i dont think so that was meant to be just a one time meeting
is it well i will be there anyways i am sleeping now so later
there isnt one
it is up to you lol
doesnt make a difference to me
well yes i am here
lol get wrecked
ya this whole thing is a fucking scam scam all day
dude the content of this course is a fucking joke so much shit that is just common sense
didnât you capture it
you were supposed to
no whatâs wrong with you lol itâs ok we can make that stuff up and i remember pretty well they were having the best time of their lives when they were using steam
it is enough to write notes
i just fucking realized the only useful course we are taking this semester is adm1100
sorry os is also useful
the stuffs we are learning in class now are not lol
literally no one uses them like who the fuck does category partitioning
ya
we are doing fucking tcases in labs nobody uses tcases
unless the software system is used for extremely important functions that involves peoples lives nobody will be as precise as to use category partitioning
tcases is a testing framework to help with category partitioning
it absolutely is
ok yo where are you now is this an actual problem or did you make that up i updated the list of malfunctions to talk about we should focus a lot on the ones that i bolded
yes significantinteresting which first one are you talking about i havent seen any examples of what you meant
because they cant get to the page in the that malfunction was reworded and bolded
yes
that is fine
i will write the one about tags but i am not going to work on it now
not necessarily
why would you want it to be free the people in education are doing things for a service they should be paid and they need the students money to earn their salary
yes you didnt say it
you
oh ya thanks this is for business right do you have notes from your friend
oh my goodness oh my damn you are saving my life like damn why are you so nice to me joydeep i dont deserve such kindness from you
 yo i will edit the content of what you wrote for the malfunctions but when you have time can you make the list of malfunctions into an organized table like the sample they gave us
yo i will rewrite the content of the first two malfunctions you described and i want you to take care of final formatting before submission
alright i did my part the rest is up to you sweet heart good luck and have fun
lol how much does it count for
and how much did i lose today
lol you guys didnt do chapter 6 thats what i read about
use sharedpreference
do we have ui class today
ok great
i will be working at crx today afternoon wanna join me do you also have a partner for the next lab
wanna join me
around 2pm i am gonna have lunch first at ucu i am gonna be at crx for a long time today my house donât have air conditioning and it is killing me actually maybe i will come tomorrow
i am probably going both today and tomorrow definitely today its totally up to you though i am aware that you probably have more important things to do than hanging out with a nobody like me
ok
nope
dont wanna
i wont need it in the future i dont wanna buy it if i wont use it in the future
i just reached one of the big rooms at the far left end of the elevator in the area where there are cubicles there are lots of people studying here over the weekend

lemme go out and find you
ok
create a company that single handedly changes the landscape of scientific research make a dent in ai create a game development studio that makes games that make people think about their life want a beautiful and powerful waifu save education
it needs to be done i wanna make lots of money to do that
you need to tell me yours sweet heart
oh right i forgot you donât have goals oops
donât worry you got time but you need to be possessed by a career demon
the reality is you need to put yourself in a career completely to be able to judge whether you want to be in that field
then you need some help sweet heart
noodle is good thoigh
would you like me to train you ð if you live my life style your career will be boosted although the training is psychologically spartan
you ready for it
hmmm ok tell me what your plan is for tomorrow
the first
yo i think we should actually stick with time table and add tab for seg3125 assignment those two tabs might give us enough information so i want you to focus on add i will take care of time table
rule 1 finish things one at a time rule 2 finish the easiest things first rule 3 think about rule 1 and 2 in every waking moment of your life
easier things can be finished faster which makes your agenda less cluttered having less things to do gives you more focus to the task at hand
hmmmm always be selfcritical never be satisfied with what you have done always seek improvement oh ya this is another important one never lose faith in anything trust in yourself
i mean are you not motivated now i guess you arenât i think it is a combination of factors knowing what you are capable of doing and being disciplined or hardworking both contributes to your motivational level
you talk as if there is a single factor
that is fine
nothing wrong about feeling tiredbut inspirations can help you a lot
but more often than not if you are feeling tired it means that you need a break or something is not working right in your life what are your short term goals now
how is the job search going
oh nice where are they for
i mean when do you hear the result back
you will be kicked out of my training if you donât get any result this summer i am expecting a lot from you you know that right
sorry what
leading means you talk to people and tell them to get shits down do everything necessary to achieve victory
you got it wrong sweet heart controlling involves evaluation leading is the execution of your plan
facebook just updated its data collection policy
i would rather work at google google is like the true hub for digital technology now they recently published some insanely cool natural language processing papers now i wanna work there ð
no but i wanna absorb everything they know facebook ainât got nothing other thanfacebook but google is branching out to so many different sectors one of which is health science which is something i am interested in
we might have to choose something else lets use httpwwwarngrennet this will give us some easy usability issues looking at this page is giving me fucking cancer honestly we cant use this cuz it is not in english httpwwwgatesnfencescom
yo
i aint for sure if we can find any problems in that website i told you about it looks fucking bad but thats about it it doesnt break most of the heuristic standards
we arent doing that website unless you can find a better one or you can find some problems on that website
yo this website actually looks sick but if you can find problems with this site then it would be awesome too
it is not hard to find one keep doing
yo thanks for introducing me to this page too architecture is something i want to get into
it didnt take you to the top ya
oh ya
recognition rather than recall the state of the page should be recognizable you shouldnt have to click on the page to find out the state
to be honest at our level anything that looks decently professional looks pretty cool
also i got another good one for you
when i clicked on one of the house projjects it didnt take me to the top so i thought that it was loading or some shit
but it wasnt loading it had already loaded but it didnt take me to the top this is more of a bug and it doesnt happen too frequently
i mean the description is under the pictures
that would be a consistency issue probably also regarding the bug i mentioned before if you are already on the page of the project clicking on the project page again doesnt take you back to top
so that is how you would reproduce it
it is a loading bug
also your critique is more of a problem with content rather than a problem with heuristics but admittedly it is a fine line
well most websites dont but it is a heuristic guideline so we can critique that for sure
ya whatever
ok great
yes
the good doctor
everything i recommend you is good
i dont knowmaybe you enjoy some scoresese movies wolf of the wall street casino goodfellas
pulp fiction
lol they talk like you though
how is taht even an insult i talk like them
i memorized ezekiel 2517
that was even used at nick furys tomb stone epitaph the path of the righteous man
he has a fake tombstone right i forgot which movie it was from but it was on there do you enjoy anime
if you enjjoyed the music i had playing on my computer you might enjjoy garden of sinners it is a movie series
there are like 8 episodes all of which are 1  2 hours long
dont watch one piece
it is complete dog shit
i give it points for being shorter than one piece but i dont watch it so i wouldnt know
hmmmthat is ok
i think soul eater manga is better i read the entire thing
i like the first version anime better
yo i am gonna watch some dota2 i will chat with you later
thanks
i am trying to get to exempted i am going to use a 2nd year organic chemistry course i took a while back to convince the program that i dont need to take another natural science course
there you go
we can juse anything to make a website i think
you have my deepest condolences
you gotta do it again
lol which one the one from 2000 or brotherhood
good job that is the âcorrectâ one to watch
it is a joke but people commonly agree that one is the more mature and darker version it also has a more hardfought ending
yes
and it also ends in 50 or so episodes whereas the other one takes longer i believe
nope lol i have watched my friend play ac but i never played it myself why do you ask
i thought you dont play video games why are you recommending this one
you never used steam apparently
if i had all the time in the world i would most certainly do exactly that but i aint got no time now
nope just pc what games have you played on console
nowadays as in just few days ago
i see well pokemon is a pretty cool game if i get back on it i can probably play for hours i dont know actually i also actively tell myself to play games that are more meaningful to me
i aint gonna get it there are enough good games on pc
i jjust have a prejudice for games on 3ds as kids games whereas games on desktop can be more artistic in nature by the way if you are interested in architecture you should learn blender
nope
are you doing any of that now
why arent you doing it
lol yes it is
what is a priority then
you have a tough time finding jobs and focusing on school because you dont know what you want to do which prevents you from going allin on something isnt that what you told me
i meandoing the things you have intrinsic interest in is never not important and if you havent gone all in on something then you wouldnt know what you truly want
right now it is more important for you to explore your skill and interest than doing well in school and getting a good job you seem like somebody who will benefit from exploring i dont say this to everybody
google and microsoft might look for it
but they ask applicants to put down their gpa
well regardless i dont think the topic of gpa is that helpful to our original conversation
as your trainer i need to tell you that you need to focus in everything you do
do things like your life depends on them people who climb the ladder of life and gets to experience the most in this world are the ones who the most focused
everything relationships work school socio life hobby like i dont have any trouble finding directions in life because i know exactly what i want to do and i put my soul and body into making things work
i could have been a fucking carpenter a waiter a teller and i know i would enjoy all of them if i actually do them because i know i am constantly trying to improve and i know i will climb higher
i guess it can be tough for some people it certainly is tough for me so i can understand your feeling but ultimately we need friends to be happy
it is not just more fun you can say that everything in our life can be complete once we have a stable and good social life
then you gotta seek those niggers out the people who you can relate with and i never said it is easy which is why you and i have to keep struggling
what was the 1st rule before but yes you are correct
he is somebody who went all in and came out victorious why dont you hang out with the popular seg people like ben and wei
but they care a lot about their careers i thought you liked that stuff
i think you need to talk to him and try to understand him more i am arrogant too but you enjoy talking to me
i urge you to talk to the people you dont usually talk to i think you will find yourself more relatable once you get to know them
right
about what
ya i would agree with that
peng dropping wisdom bombs everyday
but you also cant force other people to take an interest in you
well nobody does but we seek companionship so we seek out others
maybe sometime down the line wtf is that first of all
so what exactly do you gain from submitting an app
i dont think we have anything to partner up on unless you have a suggestion
what app are you thinking about submitting i am busy as it is with other things
it is unlikely that i am interested i am not interested now
very unlikely i got too much stuffs to juggle in fact i got to go study now
i will talk to you another time
and take care of the seg3125 assignment i did my time
i did my time with that assignment
how did you come to that conclusion
i am gonna go to sleep now but we should talk about this tomorrow
after i wake up later
i honestly thought you disliked working with android you had lots of complains about it yo do you still remember your experience from first year physics also remember to take care of seg3125 assignment
yes you need to do that no offence but your first problem is very badly written englishwise i dont know if that was just some rough outline of what you wanted to write but you certainly cannot submit that
right so please fix that
my seg3125 projejct is about physics education i wanna do an interview with you
when are you available
obviously
sometime before friday
meet after seg class
yo look at the changes i made for you i cropped your first two images and the rest of the document became a whole lot more organized make that adjustment and submit the final version
not long honestly
you should honestly focus on being an uxui designer you seem like a creative indivdual
shiieeeeet
you like architecture it is not a strong indicator but at least shows you appreciate art
so you donât wanna be creative anymore
ok
i saw it too i think i will go check out it is rare for seminars like this to happen in uottawa
talk your homies
lol yes i noticed they got lots of vr people in japan cuz they need to make better virtual porn
you should checkout summer lesson made by bandai namco
it is a vr game featuring pretty girls they have a porn version of it i believe
that is like the closest japan is to vr porn
summer lesson itself is straight up a vr game no porn
there are two versions of the game you teach girls japanese or english depending on the version
my impression is that they are made for entertainment purposes kind of like raising a digital pet
ok
nope
my parents do not approve
i am gonna use that mnoney on more meaningful things
going on trips with my friends
well that would be pretty pathetic honestly
i imagine this is not in uottawa
who is this person
ya i dont know her whats her problem
what problem did she have with seg
a new rule always ask why people do things
helps you understand other people
i never said you need to judge their decision it helps you understand what is going around you nonetheless curiosity and analytical skills are important for success
well now you do
some just told me i dont need to take phy2104 what a guy
ye
do you talk to this guy a lot
yes
i do
you are not allowed to share this with nobody this package dies with you and me
you got the package
ok
when i have time
yes
i dont know ask bjian
what
the only time you should let emotion have power over you is when you are channeling its energy for positive change any other time always be objective
actually
it is better to be objective all the time but that assumes you have perfect knawledge you need to have installed book shelves with over 2000 books for that kind of skill
ok that wasnt very funny
but the bottomline is being emotional is actually a weakness when it comes decision making
not really theoretically speaking there are really no situations where being emotional will lead to a better outcome than being objective but being emotional helps other people to sympathize with you thats like the only good thing
i already took mechanics
no first year in uottawa
ya
there are still a few like networking
ya i aint looking forward to that but i have to take it
it will be hell regardless
not one bit
no one does
it has no application to my business ideas
ya i am not gonna be disrupting telemarketing or anything
not many school has it
or you mean architecture as an art form
lazor office work
thats architecture as an art form you mean industrial architecture
i odnt know what their program is
dude honestly i should have gone to carlton
they got a game dev program so it is easy to talk to people in the game dev community and their engineering program is supposedly better than ottawas
you know what uottawa has given me lots of leeway in terms of courses i will give them that
being relaxed is also a good thing
not really i was just being a whiny bitch back there
ya
engineering mechanics wasnt that bad though i learned some classical mechanics stuff that might help with game dev i just saw an advertisement for grammarly talk later girl good night
pretty sick
now i am really curious
not right now i will do so after i come back from japan
i aint for sure if i wanna work there at the moment unless they have a department in natural language processing
you need to find out on your own it is something i cannot explain with words
what is matrix
i aint for sure
i honestly thought i would be learning way more stuffs during lecture
i will probably learn more stuffs from the project than from lecture ya
why
like a programming course i should have stuck with technology and society oh wait honestly i am learning some things in this course but it honestly could have been more concise and fast paced
nope shieeet i gotta get that shit going
good gracious
yes maâam
why do you have to deal with coop you mean like you got interviews coming up
i still dont understand why you are stressed out about your course sequence liek it is worrying you to death not going to the wedding is not going to help that
you need to figure out what you wanna do i mean why did you have such a hard time finding a job for fall coop
why donât you wanna do one for fall
and if you donât
coop might be able to tolerate you being behind nvm you still wanna graduate earlier if possible and changing the course sequence can help that then you should tell them
you will get a free summer or semester
that is not a terribly bad thing
no it ainât you donât wanna find jobs through coop
a free semester is very valuable you should do something that you enjoy doing or something that is meaningful to you you donât necessarily have to find work for that semester
you find taking orders from somebody more important than building skills by your own will if you get to work at your dream company then it is worth it but even then
this isnât about building a company it is about building your skill honestly forget i said anything my situation is different from yours
being a hero is tough trying to be a samaritan is tough trying to do the right thing is tough i hope his company is successful in getting the 5kweek goal
looks nice elon is my literal god i try to be everything that is good about him
and not be everything that he is not good in like wrecking the car
well literally speaking yes but everybody needs a role model
thanks joydeep i didnt think i was worthy of your admiration but still appreciate it god i am such a narcissit
who is it
peng
ya taht guy is a real piece of work
ya i have he gave me advice the first time i met him but then he didnt talk to me again after that i guess i was too much of a smallfry in his eyes
first year
i dont think that is a hard question i saw him several times after our first encounter i dont think he thought i was cool enough
well everybody does so that is why that last one is not that significant
but the other ones definitely are
i am not desperate to make friends with that guy honestly but i would take the opportunity to talk to him if i see him facetoface
ya i know
he came back for the graduation a few days ago thats what i was told by somebody and i guess he went back
are you sad that he didnt call you out
graduation was just like a week or two ago right
but we definitely had the engineer faculty graduation earlier because malek mentioned that he wanted to cancel a ui class so that we can attend the ceremony
ya
you sent a photo i think peng graduated in this period right kyle told me ya i am pretty sure he graduated wouldnt take it so harshly
kyle told me that he was supposed to be back earlier for this convocation to hand out rings or some shit
i dont know what is going on that is what i heard
maybe this is all horseshit
yo i just asked peng he didnt come back but he can still give out iron rings
what do you want me to do tell you just got granted exemption from discrete structure another course down
i took a very similar course back in uoft
it is the next course after discrete math
i am too
but this is about as good as it gets for my course sequence i got an email
yes i submitted a request to be exempted to the undergraudate office there aint nothing much you can do about it i am in a special circumstance
lol ya that is such a waste of time
i was actually so mad at the ontario curriculum for forcing me to take these shits
accreditation is controlled by the province level
uottawa follows the provincial guideline and elected to make students take phy
so have you decided to go back to toronto
well good luck on it then
avoiding it is not gonna help you with any of your problems
thats good
then do them
ya i am doing it now it is like a puzzle
no register only comes up a little bit anyways i gotta get back to work myself so i will talk to you later
yes
first year i just kind of accepted taking some of those courses because i didnt know much about the system
but then when i switched to software they requested me to take some goddamn first year chemistry and physics courses and then i was like thats it i aint taking this shit
but honestly i didnt mind those courses in the first year i learned some new things and the first year discrete math wasnt exactly the same as the one that i took at uoft
i feel like most of the stuffs that i learned at uoft discrete mathematics were more useful like we did a lot of predicate logic at discrete math but then in uoft they were analyzing and proving runtimes
but in discrete math we only did proof near the end of the course
ya it does it is a pretty common concept
proofs of what lemme find the website for you for the course
but my overall impression is that the first year computer theory course was a lot more applicable for computer scientists we did a lot of run time assignments sorry proof assignments
like we look at an algorithm and prove that it doesnt fuck up or something
or that it does fuck up lol
no at uoft we were learning those things in data structures in first year computer theory
not really
they are very easy concepts with the right professors and damn they did have the right professors
pretty fucking far man
ya pretty much
i think at uoft there is less selfstudy because the lectures are not as bad as it is here less people skip as compared to uottawa
professors do make a huge difference experienced that first hand enthusiasm and clarity are both important
you are taking databases i
jesus fucking christ and i had expectations taht i can learn great stuffs about databases here
but that is extra time outside the class they are not meant to replace the time i am wasting in class jesus
well i am already just barely skimming by anyways
and skip all the lectures ive been contemplating whether i should abandon my game dev interest for now and pursue improvement in my knowledge in the ml field that just seems like a much better plan careerwise
i thought about continuing them both too
i just like focusing on one thing at a time but maybe doing two things at once is a new challenge thanks for your thought
well both of us are very aware of that there needs to be a revolution
this is a politicalbusiness problem
lol what do you want to analyze
government needs to tell the universities to step up their game or the government needs to force universities to change the way they are teaching students i guess they are both the same thing
like i said in the past university is actually quite inefficient at teaching people the only good thing about it is that you can meet great people who can shape your future in universities
i think most people are actually ok with that honestly it is just people like me and you who are too smart who sees how things can be done better lol
i think something that can potentially fight against universities from a business standpoint is an organization that can present to students a complete package encompassing theory and application but focuses a lot more on application and online courses
hmm not necessarily focused on bringing students tow ork force but it focuses on eliminating universitys majojr weakness which are the courses
and also enhances its existing strength which is human relationships and having people work on projects is a great way to get people to get together to talk about their field
ya for sure
ya thats the whole idea of it but for this whole thing to work the students must adopt a selflearning attitude which is pretty much impossible at this day and age
they do get burnt out from school but the teachers also dont know any other way to teach students other than burning them out and their rewardpunishment approach in teaching is making students dependent on stimulation for learning
i mean like 3 hours or so and i gotta actually get back to fucking work and focus on finishing these shits
you could have gotten an online degree but then you wouldnt have met peng and me anyways yo i am gone now talk to you later
good
ya kind of just gonna take this objectively
none of that passion for learning dog shit
i think you will have time to do things in coop but it doesnât have to be an online course
why do yo uwant to take online course
you should read a text book and i gotta get back to studying sorry


ok is there something i can help you with
what was your section again
ya i think that is decent but i was always confused about the difference between recommendations and the implementation of solution alternatives i mean
ok
i mean we are probably gonna do a mix of the solutions honestly
i have been doing jackshit with it since studying for operating system midterm
this thursday
but i got all these other assignments and dogshits and i am watching my dota2 right now
ya
what is ac
oh right
httpsgithubcomtianrenwang this is me on github
11
do something while yo uare waiting shits happen
pretty slow why dont you go inside and ask
then guess you just gonna have to wait it out huh
you ó°
not gonna do anything until wednesday
just did so we gonna follow proper version control convention i meant proper version control practice
i meant that are we going to make separate branches when we want to make changes or do we just directly make the change on the main branch
ok and when the branches are reviewed they merge into the main right
i will take on that task but i wont be able to do it now
yo did you talk to anybody about seg3125 lab i am confused at what they mean by mockup
lab
nvm i got it
this stuff does not have to be functional basically
lol thanks
jesus fucking christ thanks for the link
i think he doesnât spend enough effort preparing for the lectures he is only a part time prof
i saw his picture hung on the hallway in mnt though
i forgot but he must have done something amazing in the past
he is a part time prof uottawa has so many part time profs i wonder why
fadi
finished cognitive and is on interaction style chapter 1 12
staying for business i aint that desperate like most people
i am chill and relaxed i dont need to sacrifice class time for an exam
indeed i will that is expected of me
from me by the way ui prof gave back midterm but that was just for you to look at your grade
he will upload the grade later
i dont think it is next tuesday oh wait yes it is lol i have no idea wtf i am supposed to be working on right now i will try to finish all qa dogshits today
then i will work on the lab for friday
ya
well the ui is supposed to be functional but the results of the actions do not have to be
lol backend search with sorted list they need to be ordered in terms of their review
ya i am sure it is just dogshit dont worry about it
make sure that you have me when you show the website oh wait i also need to email the prof about our group actually i will just go with you on tuesday
when do you plan on finishing it
ok i will definitely be there to help you out with that
yes
ya definitely i just finished os midterm will get to qa then it will be seg
it went alright it was tough probably 80 or so
ya it aint so bad
i am interest in the advertisement targeting algorithm
i am trying to learn how to take advantage of users personal information data so that i can help build a similar platform to help the politicians in india
arent you from india
also i want to learn how to run a business
should i betray my fellow teammates and hog this personal project like mark zuckerberg or should i sell the code that my teammates made to another company like the professor sold the facebook data to cambridge analytica
if that is the case i should just quit being a developer i didnt go through all this trouble of making the greatest invention of mankind just to have it stolen by some halfassed hack
mr zucc i wonder if the twin you worked with felt that too when you stole facebook
ya shit i forgot their names
this kid lol i dont know he graduated and started working like when he was 22 i am gonna be like 6 years late compared to this guy
i dont know what you want me to read you have more than one paragraph and i dont know what you dont understand about the third alternative state your confusion
if you try to educate people about facebook they might see it as you trying to damage control the recent scandal facebook trying to damage control that could leave a bad impression on people
3rd one if you are going to educate people about your product then your product have to live up to standard otherwise it would seem like empty promises
yes yo i got a question about your html code is there a reason why you have so many a tags on this line a classnavlink hrefa hrefbookshtmlused a so i think that fixes the problem
i am gonna be driving for the next 4 hours talk to you later
yes i will be
working right away
sorry but i think i will still have to work on the qa today i had some problem finishing it last night
well i dont fucking know how to make it functional
ya
i am totally cool with that i will start a new branch for that
link it to the button
ya lots of things to worry about i will try to take care of it
ok
ya that is right actually so that could be an useless argument
i am a perfectionist so i tend to think about things that are hard to attain but evidently that is not a reasonable thing to ask of companies most companies anyways
i am officially back online this page can help you with checkout page httpwwwicdevgrouporgdocframesiccattut35html
we need to move all the content of the website to the center like the buttons at the top having them on the left hand side leaves a lot of space in the center that need to be filled
yo how is the website going
ok which one is it
hard life aint it
needing to work our asses off on canada day
yo i am gonna start making changes directly onto the main branch that way is faster
so i am currently working on book information page have you figured out a way to move the content of the page to the center
did you get the the original code from a template or something we could lose marks for not having everything in center like the navigation tabs as well as the content of the page
it is shit design
did you get the original code from somewhere
we need to keep everything consistent that is one of the heuristics it is ideal if we can use the same style as that bootstrap website template for everything
alright so we gonna keep everything as it is for now then you know what since we only got one day to work on this anyways i am satisfied as well if we jjust get the functionalities there
yo i wanna ask you are you going to implement the browse functionality
i just realized we dont need a browse tab searching for books can be done with the search functionality
but categories will need to be implemented
i will look into it
we just never took a real class on it officially hence your frustration i can understand it
hmm ok got the drop down menu working you were missing js references in the body
um no you just make a page that has the payment form and a confirmation button the content of the form should be static
yo are you making any changes to the navigation bar in the pages that you are working on
since we are going to code pages statically we should make a final decision on what the navigation bar looks like so that we dont have to make any more changes to it you dig
i can push my latest changes and you will see what the current nav bar looks like i think it is finalized
does the user enter the checkout page through the shopping cart and i need to know the name of the shopping cart html file so i can link the navigation to it
what is the name of the html file
are you sure
it is not shoppingcarthtml you know what if there is a discrepancy we can change the name of the file later
did you change any other file
ok push your changes
then merge it
did you merge it yet
i dont see your merge i am doing git pull and it is saying i am up to date the only change that i see that was made recently was the one i made yesterday
can you do a git status
i typically do git push and then i make a pull request
ok i just took care of this for you so continue to work on your checkout form let me know when you finish working on it
right you should do a checkout on master and work from there
anything that is not part of the necessary functionality should be removed
i will be driving 4 hours today i am coming back from toronto in a few hours
i live like 25 minutes by bike from gatineau
jesus fucking christ
it is a mistake of course
how far are you with the seg lab
you got the error messages done
ok get that stuff done at least i dont mind losing marks on this lab i am not gonna work myself to death over 5
that being said if i didnt know so little about web design i would have worked on this a lot sooner
i did it is now called bookfindhtml
you just need to do a git pull and yours will automatically update
what old one are you talking about
oh ok
i am gonna go to sleep now whatever amount we get done we will submit the search is working individual book information is working just need to work on category and shopping cart
did you do a git pull if your branch is not updated to the latest then it wont let you push
please come to lab right now i will try to help you
sorry i was playing a game for the whole day
dota
they are addicint if you are good
it could be
well seeing stuffs like this just makes you feel how underwhelming uottawa is
it takes some real leadership to be able to pull out something close to what these guys have done cuz that project is super multidisciplinary
yo you just gave me a new idea you and i should do a chatbot group in uottawa
i aint for sure yet my idea is a chatbot for science that is a pretty useful field to have a chatbot for
i mean it makes answering questions that much easier you can ask the chatbot a scientific question and it can spit back the right answer who wouldnt want that
it is possible unanswered questions can be possibly inferred from existing knowledge
theory is something that has been tested extensively and proven to be true numerous times a model is a hypothetical depiction of reality that provides a framework for thinking about how something behaves
i donât know
elon musk is already the iron man i have to be the next elon musk
haha thanks for the encouragement i really appreciate it
i did
there is no formal binding me to that place now no formal contract at the moment it is month by month
you cant come to my place the landlord is selling the house
i mean is there a legal reason for that
lol yes it is
how is your seg project going i am expecting a great product rom you
what are you making again i dont believe you ever told me
what is new about your app there are quite a number of good ones out there i am using one myself
got fucking dunked on
lol i did pass alright i got 50 that was the single lowest score i ever got in uottawa but i didnât try hard enough and i underestimated the course content
no they were all taught in class but they werenât taught well enough
you gonna take that in september
there are ways to do well in this course you just need to clarify your understanding with the prof for everything he teaches
overlaps
possibly i aint for sure if that is the case overall
lol i saw him walked up to you today i told you you need to talk to people first before making judgment about them
congraturations when are you goin
did they like say anything about you going
gg gg wp that is quite a lot i am so happy for you and your app today was kind of disappointing
lol they sure are desperate
whamen need to respecc them
lol me in need of contacts from whamen blasphemy
i was just kidding i appreciate the opportunities offered by whamen tell them that you know this overpowered developer he is looking for a job after he comes back from japan
ya
those are my major ones i am also very interested in educational techs specifically ones involving gamification
people dont have to come to class and listen to part time profs
i dont know but i wasnt referring to him specifically
nope httpstianrenwanggithubio
ya i really wanna bring back my dead grand father because i miss him so much
oh shit wait they cremated their bodies
i dont know for publicity
yes
it is not a game he was baffled he asked me some questions out of curiosity of what goes behind such a project
i answered his curiosities i basically told him this is the greatest project a software engineering student could undertake in our level and that he shouldnt expect the same for other students
thatâs what i am lol but those were not my exact words i was more humble than that
final version httpstianrenwanggithubio check it out
take ur time
damn straight it better be loading
to show that a force is being exerted on it
in scenarios where the cube doesnt move even if you are exerting a force it is easier to not forget that the responding properly if the color is changing
lol ok
ya this is the starting point
i will spend some more time perfecting it over the next few months damn straight
research
i gotta read lots of papers my colleague who went before me was still reading papers even after a month of working kind of sad to be honest
i just feel like reading only papers for a month is a waste of time you should be reading papers and participating in research activities simultaneously
and one month i feel is too long for jjust purely papers
i feel like something like that should be gotten over with within like 2 weeks i get an impression that guy isnt trying hard enough anyways acitivites like actually developing experiments
dude i know about them
they made an ai that defeated the best dota2 players 1v1 last year in ti
this year they are creating a team ai to 5v5
well i know about that too
lol
well neither of us can do that now can we
no like doing it at 15 years of age ya thats the whole point
being able to do it at 15
why are you interested in this kid lol
i know i suggested to you before that the only thing you can do about papers that you dont udnerstand is to read it endlessly
spending a few months reading up the basics of things
that is why i am reading a textbook on nlp right now
i was trying to read up some google papers on nlp but i didnt understand any of it no it is a digital version of a physical textbook that came out in 2008
ya at this point i might just go work for google if i pitch them business ideas they might provide support for them and the kind of stuffs i want to do is right up their alley
ya that
i feel like ai and internet is more up their alley than most other things
and education is something google should be interested in immensely
just not gaming
that is true it is so hard to beat these companies since they have such strong foothold in their industries the only way to beat them it to have an overwhelming innovation i feel
khan academy is not
it really depends on your mindset if you are an innovator and loves discovery wholeheartedly then everyday can be a walk in disney land for you filled with excitement
if you are a career powerhouse who wants to walk up the research ladder then everyday is a struggle against time and funds lonely in what way
the kind of work does lend itself to solo yes
and furthermore you will be working in a research team in the institution every member of which can help you and collaborate
no
no it is hands on it is both theoretical and hands on

what do you want me to say about it yo are there anything fun to do in ottawa besides movies
the fuck is blues fest it is basically over dude
i am just bored to death studying all day
i had the same problem last week i just holed up in my room all weekend and it was fucking boring
wanna do something tomorrow
i dont got no ideas
you wanna watch a horror film tomorrow it is called hereditary
nope havent seen it are you gonna recommend taht shit
so you have seen it
alright then we gonna see it do we need to book it can we just like walk in
no no i meant ant man
i dont got nothing better to do so
alrigth then i guess i will just spend a boring sunday again then
we can go at night i donât wanna watch noting
yea i want you to tell me where the movie is gonna be at then i will look into buying it yo we can go on tuesday tonight i watch antman
lol your inner fangirl is showing but to be fair i would probably request the same thing when people watch my favorite movies
taking os is really making me want to drop out of school if i understand this content i can teach this stuff so much better than these jagoffs
the textbook is complete shit the lecture slides are shit and nobody understands the prof in class
lol you are right thanks for reminding
one with ac
it doesnt matter which honestly the one that is closest to your house
he doesnât
i am using udacity they are free
alright just watched antman 1 it was damn stupid fine
yes i am in it
sure
ya find the place did you get a place
are you for fucking real
well we fucked up didnt we maybe we can go next tuesday
ya
for grace hopper harass them i guess
yo can you look for the ticket today if we do it now we donât need to worry about it not being available next week
fuck that shit antman over exams any day
which exam is this
we can study together if it makes you feel better if we study together you will definitely pass
well i will always be at crx
whenever i dont have class and whenever i am on campus
i will be in crx the whole time tomorrow after like 1pm until 4pm or maybe even earlier than 1pm if you come now i can help you study but i will be studying os
no i dont have one
ui exam  very important  chapters 1  13  need to be able to produce the requirements scenarios and storyboard  still need to understand evaluation well  nothing on  chapter 14
i dont know
maybe we need to memorize everything
cuz i donât mind it
memorization gets lots of bad rep but it actually accelerates learning well for things that are complex at least
you should think about that as a limitation in your intellectual prowess and aim to improve it if you memorize the right things then it can help drastically in your learning
yes yes seg is a bad example the key is to memorize key concepts lol i am captain obvious
yes
very far end on the left after you exit elevator
ya i will do it when i get back home thanks for reminding
yo i want your notes for adm
fwang100uottawaca thanks i owe you massive amounts
oh hell yes thank you sweet heart got it so bad
i have no clue jjust gonna read it and internalize it
thanks i got it covered
i dont know how bad outside is and honestly i am not at the level of expertise to answer your matrix question
i will get back to you on wednesday
good stuff we should have went for ant man movie
i got car
lol gg that looks ð·
i was actually complimenting your work cuz it looks sick
there is a lecture today i dont know most likely not
no i didnt relaly think much of it
240 sweet heart there are so many sweet hearts in this world
it is indeed 140
monday how was adm did you get dunked on
i think i did good on everythabg i didnât memorize every lecture slide for nothinâ
this has nothing to do with bio degree anybody can memorize if done right you should have taken my advice
you think these business stuff goes into my head i remember them long enough to write exams and if i am lucky then i get to use the knowledge and keep them longer i just brute force that shit
i was playing a game of dota to kind of relax after a day of exams
damn straight i nervously smiled after i finished that exam and some thought it was a happy smile
i felt like i walked on top of a string and i didnt fall down
i havent done it yet i am doing it for os right now
i will do the ui tomorrow and monday
thanks how many exams do you got left
2 as well
ya
ya immediately after the exam finishes i am gonna park my car on campus and then drive off is ui your last exam
excellent can i use your cheat for ui
gg
you mean for os it is excellent the best cheat sheet i ever made
ok
well i think i might do better than my midterm and that is always good by the way amar is supposedly making a cheat sheet for everybody so i am gonna wait on that
leaving tomorrow afternoon
canât do it it was fair
ok i will be in toronto between aug 14 to 20th
yes i will be around for a few days before september
explore what
lol why would you explore japan before i start work
you are so considerate for me
reread but i dont know how much that will help lots of stuffs to reread
nope i can print one for you if you need one
you have to
i dont think it is inferior
his
how do you know i am in school
yes it was ust a lucky guess nothing special right you are not super smart or anything right
in morisset library
in the media room
it is on the second floor they have like mangas and gaming console here
oh ur back in toronto i am
how was it got dunked on
it is uncertain how i did all the questions were straight forward but i might not have been careful enough with them
ya i had time to check over my answers more but i didnât because it was such a boring exam straight out of the book
challenge brews motivation
good for you you law abiding girl
i am just wasting time honestly tomorrow whole day i am gonna learn german
probably watching youtube videos arey ou gonna watch movie all week
how else are you gonna spend your time then
damn you are gonna be productive as fuck no materials are ever hard with good teachers
uoft didnât always supply good teachers but when they did they were always easy
not for biology
but for compsci they were
the problem is they donât have any good teaching profs there for biology because they equate good teaching with good research
but that is obviously not true well at uottawa they only hire part time profs and yes precisely for that reason every university is shit
i donât know honestly
yo yes i did
use what you learned in csi2110 understand data structures understand algorithms
it was the ieee challenge that happened last year in october i believe
how are you doing
what i did for that coding challenge was i used one of the codes that course provided and i was able to use it to completely solve one of the challenges
you make a rough outline of how you would go about solving the problem figure out the data structures you will need and figure out the algorithm
well nobody ever checks if you used a courses code but it was array list that i used and the implementation for that is not exactly difficult
ok sure good luck on it
ainât got none yet sweet heart
jesus forgive their asses
how will you keep my doors open
you can go ahead i need some people i can trust to run a startup though so i need you to focus on industry you donât learn jack in grad study
for what you want the satisfaction of having a master degree
that was my earlier modus operandi but quite honestly that is a whole lot of horse shit once you find something that is interesting to do
i donât need the degree anymore because i have stayed in the field long enough to know what i want to do what i can do and what i need to do to reach my goals
you donât need it for your success and it wastes time and money
i wanna target the scientific market it is that text mining idea i was talking to you about
education will come later the thing with the ai is a potential quick cash grab
yo what is going on with you you still wanna watch a movie
next week like wednesday or something are you close to downtown
then it is gonna have to be on the 28th i am not in town next tuesday
hey you ok these days
nothing really i miss you a lot it has only been three weeks i cant imagine what it is going to be like 8 months
one last time
oh ya how was it
the fuck is doggo dog area
like they bite and stuff
oh ok you raise a dog
that was a really awkward jjump in topic i am a cat person myself though
great stuff i will show you some of my trip photos in a bit right now my phone is charging are you still studyign algorithm
oh what are you watching stranger things
lol friends how fitting
you are very friendly
well you are friendly to me at least am i creeping you out
or we just get along too well cuz we see the garbage human beings around us
nope why do you ask
cuz there are lots of rich people
downtown near dundas and university ave
oha porscheok
ya it looked unconventional for a car but i think everything is an acquired taste
tesla is the company that got me interested in cars honestly my family has two toyota lexi but i donât have any particular interests for them they are just transport vehicles
it looks pretty sick but you are gonna look like an absolute douche to other people if you drive that around
that is so materialistic
but to be fair i am too in some way
why do you like cars though why not houses why not hardware device like computer or phone
lol wows
i mean it is great you have such interest i suppose you donât really need a deep reason for liking something in fact i am like that too
but wows though there is a 65 chance that if you fuck your cousin your kids would be fucking retarded or whatever
wolf of wall street
that was like the most famous scene of the movie you are not a hardcore fan
wolf
that looks delicious
ohhhhhhhhhh damn girl you got it good i had one myself in the past and it was good
yes i know that i love me some good old japanese cake you had the time to go down there and get one huh
was the lineup big
ya i got them do you wanna know how well i did i did so well
nothin on exam just project
sure taking their sweet time with it
i donât think it is quite what i wanted to build but i think it is a product that can have impact on a lot of different things
i still donât quite know how it works but i get the feeling that it is meant to increase employeestudent automatically for them increase learning efficiency
yo what do you wanna watch next week tuesday still antman and wasp
alright
yes
it is a hard thing to come up with for sure you just kind of have to try things out and stick with them and decide if you like it
i dont know really
i mean maybe you could your interests can change though and that is why i am telling you to try different things and stick with them
you need to find some way to get quick results when you are doing things that you mentally feel lack of affinity for the results will motivate you to move forward
something that is worth doing not something that you like doing i am watching ti8
good luck finding that
this stuff is fun to watch sorry
i would if i have a pc and playstation that will come in time
i wanna save up sorry brb watching this shit
hypest match of the day
thanks and good night to you
that is interesting but it might be solved by the way i am pretty sure we dont need to book tickets ahead of time to see this movie considering how its being out for a while now
my address is 11 inca rd in north york
well you do now
what do you think about this
i am conflicted i want to lean on the person who got fired she didnât have to lose her job but i would definitely not approve of her language
because you donât want to piss off the higher ups
she deserves to get chewed out maybe not necessairly lose her job
nobody knows who naomi h is lots of people with naomi h name actually you know what i would fire her
imagine that guy was her boss instead if i was her boss i wouldnât take no disrespect like that from her
gfuckingg
nope
yes
yo tell me where you live i wanna figure out which movie theatre to go to
ok great
i will look into it later
ok we should go to scotiabank theatre that is like the only place that i know that plays antman 2 and that the location is not boring you sent a photo i dont know which one you want
nope
by the way when do you want to go see the movie tomorrow
i would go for the one at 1pm
i dont know it is 12 just checked is that bad
oh wait
it is 9 sorry i chose the 3d option
ya regular that is 9 not 12
no i wont 2d is fine
no
yes
so lets go for the 4pm one
ok
alright i will book later
sure look into it you know my address
extremely
ya i do but in japan they donât count the lunch hours as work hours
yo have you decided on a location
yo what exactly are we watching tomorrow that theatre doesnt have antman and wasp should have went when we were still in ottawa
what did they think do they even understand fantasy films
i wouldnât i am an exception though everybody but me can benefit from an mba degree if they want to be a manager of a company
you were hampering on about getting a master after this a while back yo i changed my mind again letâs meet up tomorrow at your suggested place but that place still doesnât have antman2
i mean i can watch mi without seeing the prequels i am sure i can enjoy them nonetheless especially since you will be there
i dont give a fuck i am there to see the actions the plot is probably not that interesting anyways
are you for fucking real when was the appointment made
you need to confirm that time right now the show time is at 3pm if you can do it before then then we cool the dental appointment that is
i dont really do much other than movies when i hang out with friends honestly but we can have lunch possibly at another time if you cant do tomorrow
you are gonna come downtown for that i thought that was too far for you do you wanna watch the meg
what
that is a movie
ok but you would come downtown to do things more than just movies like what would you want to do downtown
thatis quite a huge trip why dont we just stick with movies just something simple
we can do it another day if you cant tomorrow
ive been to the toronto island and there aint nothing there honestly i leave this sunday
i got my fair share of good views in europe i dont need no more of that shit and good views doesnt motivate me that much honestly
i went right after the last exam if i want good views i want to go somewhere that is exotic toronto island is as normal as you get
you got until friday to think up of an idea but if you really want to do something downtown we can take a walk around waterfront unless you have already been there
i dont live downtown though so some parts of the town will be novel to me
yes i would love to actually
i wouldnt go without friends honestly
so when do you wanna go
friday then dont wanna do anything the day before i leave for japan
yo have you decided where you wanna go on friday
and you have found a good location
alright and are we doing anything afterwards
i aint for sure to be honest i guess we can just chat and stuff i will walk around the neighborhood it is very close to where i went to highschool you did that for your first year right
i dont eat ice cream unless it is green tea flavored yes
is indeed one of your channel
i had but i feel sick thinking about how much calorie is packed in that thing
it doesnt even taste that good in my opinion
if i am gonna load myself with calorie its gotta be good
i can check it out with you
i will see what other stuffs they got on menu
if they are doing ice cream they gotta have some other stuffs
ohferrari thats nice
oooohhhhh testla i want a piece of that
i didnt know that but i dont think elon minds that i am actually way more interested in a nonluxury electric car
oh good you are on top of it
you gonna have to work hard to get them cars like really hard
only one for what who will work hard
i mean yes that is true but i fail to see why you bring that up are you competing with other people for how many cars you collect
ohhhh ok good for you guys yo can you give me a list of the channels that you used when you looked for jobs actually dont it is meaningless to look for jobs now
after this one which ends on may 2019 is may 2020 i go back to school for a year then start my next coop
ok those are some good advice by the way i am talking about finding a job for summer of 2019 not for the coop summer of 2020 because next summer i am technically not in coop
yes
nope i had a skip a semester because my course sequence needed to change due to my 8month coop
it does i am one semester behind
i believe so too
gfuckingg
it will be a challenge for sure i am gonna memorize algorithms and shit lol
anytime is cool honestly
yo last time when you did your mass job application what was your interview rate like
it motivates me more if i know what i am working towards
nvm forget it but i was only just curious what your situation was when i asked that question i know it varies from people to people but that doesnt stop me from being curious
send in resumes to application pages of companies is that what you did
do you do all that for each company
lol what
where is this
what do you mean you are booked you got other interviews going or you had plans with friends
jesus lol
did these all come recently cuz i remember talking to you about this a while back and you mentioned you didnt get many interviews
depends on what you have to cancel to go to this interview
it is your call but from the sound of it you got enough interviews to not be bothered by missing this one see what their reaction is
i mean you can say it in a cocky way if you want
i did but i am losing motivation
my experience with online application is that i typically never get selected for interview and this stuff can take hours to do
but with your encouragement maybe i can do it
who the fuck is leo
you didnt can i get a copy
fwang100uottawaca
gg did you like work through each of these companies one by one
alright i think this is a good starting point lemme sift through your list first though
why isnt google on this list
lol ok ya i will
but yo is even now like a good time to apply
how about for summer semester
alright
gg do you even have 3 references i only have like two good ones maybe i should ask fahid for a reference
and if they are starting hiring for summer next month why dont i start next month instead of now
cuz there is a chance they might not take your resume if they are not starting until next month right i wont be that busy i will work 96pm
i dont know i am just testing your reasoning but if you suggest now then i will start now
96pm aint busy
i can work from 711pm
no i meant i will go back home and work on the applications from 711pm
this conversation we had might go down in history
if i get a jojb in toronto or in any high tech company i might be able to snowball hard into a strong career and i will make use of that to become a famous man
was that list purely for toronto
you got some top comapnies in there from toronto tribal
top hat
why are you even looking at this
i dont see whats so special about this
lol that is a good thing
ontario institute of cancer research doesnt use software engineers just to let you know i know what they do they need people with a background in biology in addition to being able to program and do statistical analysis
where does it say that
can you give me a link to what you saw on oicr i am super curious now i cant find that coop page actually i got them or they might post them in secure channels like waterloo coop
the music brings back good old memories
yes i did used to be a big fan of the game for the second and third generation
ya
why
print whatever amount you can physically carry around what is important is how well you communicate your enthusiasm
i guess thatâs your limit then
i am actualy do it in like a month or two possibly in october i think doing it is kind of pushing it and i got other things i want to spend time on
udemy course on machine learning
well i am doing udemy
congraturations you going to town
once or twice during trips
that was like a long time ago to washington and new york
i donât know went there like more than 10 years ago so i donât remember but it was definitely bigger
yo you wanna go to the cat cafe at 11am meet up there tomorrow and if you are interested we can walk around down town and chat and stuff
ok lemme see how this will work out then then when is the earliest you can meet tomorrow
ok then we meet at the cafe at 230 maybe stay there till like 330 or whatever
if you are interested you can come with me downtown afterwards
we will see what happens
oh man this is gonna be tough do you wanna meet later my dentist appointment is forcing me to come at 230 and adjustments probably will take like an hour nvm just called will take around 30 min
sorry when do you have to leave
ok and you wanna meet at 340
why 340 as supposed to 330 joydeep missed your video chat
ok sure
6472429878 i understand the plan though so i dont think there is much more to talk about
lol busy joydeep making time for me
i am just joking
yo just to make sure the cat cafe that you want to go to is the one close to eglinton and mt pleasant right
some good stuff is here
tell me your news first
ok that is pretty good
is that the news
thats hardly anything are you in school now
i aint asking where you are physically
but are you enrolled in school
ok lets see i havenât taken many honestly you sent a photo
but this is the otaku life people dreamed of
i used to be but not anymore
its not like i jerk off to anime girls everyday
i also really like the fashion sense for ladies here in japan you sent a photo
thats actually a good point
yes that was a work cloth but a regular cloth would be very close to that in style
i read a blog on it just now
sorry not a blog but a forum httpswwwrooshvforumcomthread67129html the prospect seems good
lol what
i am on the less sociable side of the spectrum so i might not be able to replicate the same level of success
i feel like you can exude that air of sociability just with your profile i almost never get matched on tinder
ya that is totally true i am gonna expand my social sphere here
dont worry i got this
ya i will
climbing mt fuji tomorrow night that is the first major place i want to visit some aquariums nearby
honestly i am done with travelling for a long time
i have done too much of that recently and i realized that i dont enjoy it as much as most people i am a career man i lack an intrinsic interest in the things around me
if you want my straight answer not really but it sounds good
i wouldnt listen to it all the time
your friends dead
so is that your cat
who the fuck is manisha
i think i know who might that be but you live with her
lol i didnt know he smoked
work is good relaxing and meaningful
very close like 10 minute walk
you bet it is on the side walk of a bustling portion of the city i saw a bunch of people playing pokemon go mostly adults but even old timers were playing
i just woke up i am gonna prepare for mountain climbing today how about you how are courses so far
what are you taking this semester
lol chem
not me
they are mostly lower level courses there are still a lot of higher level courses has many prereqa
ya i already dont have to take chem
no i have not i will apply in october
thanks
i am climbing tonight so we can see the sunrise at the top how is your job search going
keep on keeping on
hard to get them to hire you
you know what that is true i was just talking about of my ass just now
sleep which happens right now
night
gg
work is awesome i am working with computer vision now
doing experiments and shit on human vision thanks girl
yes sir
after i come back to canadahonestly i am just gonna be the top dog of the department
yes
lol the fuck was he ripped
did you ask for his number or some shit
i guess so what kind of people do you find attractive
looks wise thats the only thing most people care about anyways am i vain for saying that or am i just more in tune with reality
yes
so i aint wrong for saying looks matters
like me peng
maybe i act your age huh
do you feel i am much older than you
dang it girl
hey by the way you never answered if you were attracted to me
you are clearly avoiding answering it is a yes or no question
lol thatâs good enough for me see how easy that was
yes i did but forgot most of it the only thing i remember from that class are general concepts
that is not bad
i will see
it is on my course schedule so i will have to take it
welllit is uottawa they keep you shut with money
shut us up with money i ainât gonna complain when they are throwing money at me all day i got another 1000 just today for going on an international coop
yes
nah
yo i am gonna hit the sack now i will talk to you later girl
congratulations you should work on your muscles
lol lower half bet your lower half hasnât experienced much in life
congratulations
hey whatâs up
learn what
why dont you get caught by the police you fucking scumbag piece of shit i just woke up and i am learning machine learning
i will eat lunch instead of breakfast
japanese curry
today is a national holiday i think i am gonna go watch a movie and play mahjjong
seriously wtf are you doing
you still havent got no jobs
i guess you gotta keep looking
it was tough
to the top
you heard me right
you sent a photo there was honestly nothing at the top it was very cloudy
you sent 3 photos the first one is precisely at the summit the next two were like an hour after i started hiking down
the fuck is finder you mean tinder ya i used it quite a bit no match lol work is going great lemm show you my starter photo on tinder you sent a photo
haha ya thats pretty much how i think about this too lol
i know people who are successful with it but my specific city might be too small
i chatted with a girl on tinder and apparently she also had no matches for some reason which to me seemed weird because girls normally get a hell of a lot more matches than guys without even trying even when you have no good profile photos
and hers seemed decent cuz it showed off her figure
kana but she is only interested in friends and we practically dont talk anymore
i dont like clubs and i gotta go to work now later
thanks hey girl whatâs up boy do i miss you
i need you to give me a description of an ideal boyfriend
fwang100uottawaca
thanks for putting effort in this
i want to know your taste for reference
wtf a unity booth
i donât wanna work for unity tell them that gamin is a waste of time and they should be ashamed of themselves for driving that urge to game talk to google for me though
what are some outer appearance or features of a guy that would make you consider dating him
ok go on
hmm ok
how about their hobbiesinterestsway they spend time i am thirsty for some japanese girls ainât got none so far i am also disappointed in how lacking my interaction with the local has been
lol
you and i that would be nice
actuallythat is such a brilliant idea i donât know why i never though about it but maybe things will be less awkard if i go with you
anyways i gotta work now
good night by the way
what is this fjnal party
are you into socializing
if you are then this is made for you
fuck the assignments this is what like all night connections you make here can be more important than some assignments that donât care about your future
but like i said you should only go if you think you can get something out of it
dancing is a form of networking
you should go if you can enjoy it can you enjoy it that is the important question
then go oh lol why are you asking me this
donât go if you donât have the clothes
i hate that stuff
this guys experience first year on tinder is exactly like mine i will keep listening to this but first some breakfast oh i played dota with some local japanese people yesterday lots of fun
nope man he didnt get to the important parts he just said to include good photos no selfies and include a photo with an animal
i actually have no clue probably because it shows you love stuffs and is a good person
i wish i took some photos with my cats
i used to my family sold them back in january cuz we felt bad for not spending much time with them
tommy and sara
they didnt like me though so they always ran away when i got close well yes i do you sent a photo
i didnât earn their love and i purposefully scared them sometimes out of fun
well real people are not easy to scare
you ó°
i am confident and i have a high standard for the level of understanding i aim for
my study habit is fairly straightforward but one thing that really helps me is that i have high confidence in knowing which material is worth studying
in that case i do i took notes in the first year logic class because his notes in class wasnt posted anywhere else
the syllabus is too general it says what it will teach but it doesnt say what the students need to know on the final exam
is it exam period for you right now thats why you are asking me

people do find good relationships up in there but yes maybe people care a lot about sexual attraction but i feel like that is the case for a lot of dating apps
well getting hookups isnât a terribly bad idea
lol you find that surprising
i wish i had that same mentality honestly but most men in this world are lustful competing for sex is a natural thing for them i feel us i meant for me it is complicated
i can safely say that if a guy can secretly have sex with as many girls as possible he would do it often
i think i painted a little unreasonably bad picture for guys here but i think most guys also have self control when it comes to this stuff
it is a biological thing exacerbated by social expectation of what men are supposed to be like why donât you just go somewhere else or donât pay attention i would play that game
i find that is the case for most people i donât know why donât you feel that the horror game can make you scared at anything at all is an achievement of art
it makes you feel a specific emotion just like how romantic stories make you feel joy for the triumphant couple
thanks we also got a long weekend here in japan
nope i am watching videos on googleâs chess engine this engine is saving chess
it is elon musk that is making ai dota
well then show it to me deepmind doesnt deal with dota it is openai
gg thank god i ainât in canada now
the cat has health problems
i know of cats that die of heart attack because of fat
if any of his body parts look like inflated tubes you need to be careful or begins to look like
certain flesh part is supposed to be insulated with fat that is normal but i am talking about the body shape something that you will notice with appearance
i dont know pets take effort to deal with
getting a boyfriendgirlfriend can be a good stress reliever too
but you will eventually do it so why not
oh so you will be single forever
i went out to a social meetup and i chatted with some people i was a bit afraid that the meetup would be mostly guys but then it turned out there were a large number of girls as well
at a bar
it is good
jesus motherfucking christ joydeep i owe you my life this is the kind of stuff i was looking for
ya me neither i am gonna be submitting a full cv for this one
well not necessarily
i want to improve my overall skill as an engineer so that means i want to learn anything related to it
there is no industry for machine learning unless you are talking about research there are only industries that apply ml i wanna do anything that will get me the big bucks
nooi would rather do business thats where the money is at i will just apply ml there
yo are you using the schools coop portal
so you will never use the portal
have you found a job so far
i mean for the winter coop
nice where is it
oh thats the same place sherry worked at you gonna commute to kanata all day
yes i was wondering if there are any good jobs in the coop navigator
but honestly i think it is probably better if i find one myself because i will be in japan this whole time and i cant go back to canada for interviews
nah i wont stay in japan for that long
yes i know neural network now i need some practice though
how are you doing in school
anything new with you
how are you learning it
you need good understanding of linear algebra and calculus maybe 2nd year calculus
do you have a basic understanding of cl and la and some statistics
honestly i am studying nn with only calc i i am only speculating that calc ii will help make you better at learning nn
efficiency as in training and prediction
well no but most businesses use deep learning technologies
deep learning is exactly what i just said it is a common terminology used by business people to classify the ml technologies that are the most popular in the business world right now specifically nn
lotsa sugar lotsa money
i dont know maybe ben and wei
and i heard sherry is doing ml in her job
yes
what do you mean you dont know i am telling you right now that she told me that she is doing ml in her work
she told me personally that she is doing ml
ok sorry boss
i dont know she jjust said ml
i dont know you should ask her
i dont know where it is going it might work it might not if it doesnt i will have to switch to something else
i will explain to you another time when i actually know what is going on speculating abbout the project now is kind of a waste of time yes it is research
not bad
nope
i swiped all right and got my best photos but got nothing so i figured it just isnt gonna work
ya i am meeting real girls at meetups they are actually quite pretty but it is hard to get their attention unless you are an absolute charmer and i aint one
yo by the way thanks for the message sorry for the late reply i also got two interviews happening soon i actually wanted to ask you have you ever seen any of this in class before httpswwwcodementorioblogjavainterviewsamplequestionsanswersdu107xs23
sofware development intern
the reason why i asked you that question was because i was worried those concepts might come up on the interview programming challenge that i did 50 minutes ago
i did fine on the challenge so we cool
ya i know but for this position everything i knew before hand probably is enough
people in top executive positions of major institutions have denied this kind of shit for eternity but in reality they exist the world is a dark place and people need to accept that
people need to embrace dark humor for this very reason not discard it like they discard their brain like they often do in their lives
because dark humor is like brain clearly not everybody has it
yo have you ever used indeeds indeed apply the one that you just click it and indeed automatically applies for you without needing to fill out forms on the actual company website
how do you find these people
i mean how did you find those email they are usually hidden
those are like the general inquiry pages right
right ok
donât bother i canât call over sea and i gotta get up from bed and work now
6472429878
i got to look into thhis
yo i am good i just cooked my lunch
i applied to a few startups in toronto recently speaking of toronto lemme send you a photo
you sent a photo thats my stuff i didnt know the weather in toronto is shit are you in missisauga right now or downtown toronto with your friends
what is going on there the weather i meant
i see that happened quite often during the winter in ottawa i hated it when it did that the wind shield stops working when it does that i drove in one of those before
it was like 14 years old or some shit
or 13 no i wanted to do more fullstack this time around
but i applied to mostly jobs that involve ml so that i can give them ideas
we sold it cuz it had issues we sold it for like some 500 this past august yo lemme show you a list of companies i applied to you sent a photo
httpsangelcotorontojobs
ascent robotics is already reviewing my application so i dont give a shit if there is another robotics team
ya i know
well there aint ever no ends to that shit
i remember it was either one in waterloo or kitchener i forgot how is life in canada girl i wanna hear the good things happening to you
so nice being with friends aint it
why not your friends aint there for ya
cant expect much out of ottawa honestly the only thing you can do there is be friends with justin trudeau by the way how is the election coming along i dont watch news so
to me it holds the same level of importance as who wins the world cup but it is still interesting to know
comon joydeep get on with the game yo after i come back to ottawa i should seriously train you up to be super smart not that you arent smart already not to sound offensive or anything
no in the mindset for success
and skills to be super pro you were asking me about that shit a while back you do want to become stronger right
i wasnt serious with you back then i couldve been like my dad he knew how to motivate people he would have just trashed talked you all day until you get an inferiority complex
that is like the only way for people who are not smart to take up the world though thats like all genetically and culturally encoded where is the fairness in that you agree with me right
so it is the correct approach right
decent i am learning deep learning like a fiend these days how about you
you donât need those degrees to be good at ml
i can tell you what extra advantage they have and they are not super fancy or powerful
it depends on if you have studied ml in undergrad i am assuming most donât
you basically learn all the common architectures which is not difficult at all
and you spend time practicing it in your research lab which is a good thing but once again it is not that superior than self learning
and then they probably perform research on a very specialized area of ml which either can or cannot help when it comes to general application
your knowledge might also be solidifed from doing research you take online courses
i mean that is incredibly rare or i mean it will give you access to higher job positions and limit lower job positions
i enjoy learning about neuroscience and its application to ai i enjoy reading nlp textbooks
yes
thatâs the only thing usefulnin this world now
nope
i got interviewed by uhn the other day and there is a good chance i might work there doing fullstackml
yes
i applied to like 10 jobs so far and barely anybody replied fuck that too much logistic
i wonât miss out on nothinf
i can dominate those pieces of shits from states anyday
yes
maybe it is better for you
yo whats up
i applied to element ai do you know about that company
no i just applied yestersay but i think this might be different from the specific job you sent me
ya you did but yo where do i apply for deepmind
but they are not specifically interns
i see
i am surprised you only started taking it this semester
it is a hard course because the concepts are not clearly explained a lot of the times
you could have asked me to explain the stuffs why didnt you ask me
yes go ahead
actually i dont remember these shits no more lol it has been a year now
ya thats pretty much how that course felt like but you gotta try hard
this is your last experience with this type of shit but then you also got operating system coming next
os is not that interesting it is not that relevant the only relevant thing they only recommend you to learn but wont test you on is using command line terminal
i got an offer from that hospital place i mentioned to you a while back i feel like i need to aim higher in choosing the right workplace
truth be told i am tempted to take this offer i got rejected from more hightier places like google and another place called ascent robotics maybe my qualification is just not enough yet
ascent robotics is the jap startup but thatâs the only one i was interested
you mean they will post openings
i will look forward to that i need to learn nodejs and javascript before they do that way i can pass their code challenge
last time i tried their challenge i didnt understand jackshit about what they were asking for and i am assuming that is because i didnt know anything bout backend
you should be more rigorous
practice mode
you should also adopt a mindset of perfection
for everything
i realized recently that the main reason why i do things so well or at least you think that i do things well is because i have a voice in the back of my head that keeps critiquing the quality of my work
i mean that is precisely one of the reasons why you are not doing well as you hope in school because you have a low expectation and you dont even bother succeeding in that low expectation
ok so you know why you are not doing well as me btw i played the first tomb raider reboot that came out like 4 years ago
it is kind of a habit at this point and slight fear that i will be discriminated by companies for having low gpa it is more the latter actually
i mean they wont not take your resume even if you dont meet their minimum requirement that is understandable
i dont know how people have time for these challenges honestly maybe they are incredibly efficient people
not really i got my hands full with learning stuffs i am spending a lot of time learning things and not much time doing them right now
i got natural language processing and web development queued up now i am taking ml courses during my work time unfortunately if you want to be good at everything you kind of have to sacrifice time for learning
just occasionally go out gym play games watch tv shows and chatting with dear friends like you ð
i gave up on it
lol
well that is actually what i am going to do now i am meeting up some japanese people
language exchange but dealing with other people is not the same as dealing with a computer you canât control them
good night thanks for staying up to chat
whatâs up
people talk but it is quieter than na
some companies do but not all the time but there are definitely more that work long hours than na of course
i donât know enough about it the people at my office works pretty hard especially the actual engineers and scientists
school will be next fall and please donât send memes i would rather want mind baffling tech news
this news doesnât affect people who make their own business
and honestly you are better off not being hired by an idiot who judge books by their appearances anyways
it was shit
it is the way they teach it
they donât teach the fundamentals well but expects you to understand rules that arise because of fundamental principles
by the way i got an email saying i got an award of excellence
yes not that i actually give a crap
i just felt like bragging
well thatâs why i donât care it doesnât matter on the resume
kind of people around me were all doing bio so i went in bio
nice
not at the moment why
i am still applying
nope the employer said to take my time
by the way you should take the coursera deep learning course i was checking them out two days ago just out of curiosity and it is hell of a lot better than udemy i think
you only need basic calc and linear algebra but i am just saying dont take udemy udemy is for the plebs
at least for deep learning the best courses are really bad at explaining
there are some nice unity courses
so the best course by rating doesnt go into enough depth unity i meant that not all udemy courses are bad so the best course by rating doesnt go into enough depth on udemy
i think it is better taught than the udemy course i wont be stuck trying to figure out what he is saying although i am only on the second lecture we will see yo how are you doing
oh nice must be freezing in ottawa now
well it is not 10 degrees oh wait canada is in the positive now nvm
yes 10 degrees niw by the way i am gonna be working at the hospital during the summer i heard nothing from any of the companies i applied for
i think i will do better next year
ya i got everything
you should apply to it
well maybe next time
singapore seems like a decent city
oh really that was not what i associated with singapore
i actually thought that singapore is mostly just a beautiful city with an asian culture that makes them strong in technology
nope why would i
it is rhetorical when are your exams
i hope you do well on them you can do it
and watch marvel movies
good stuff
yes
just came back from comiket bought some doujin hentai
 you donât like hentai
oh ok of course you wouldnât
i mean i just didnât want to pay for the plane ride
it seemed inefficient to go back to canada how are you doing i hope the exams were fortuitous for you and you are spending quality time with your loved ones
so young
i wish i am 20 right now you need to do the things you love
by the way merry christmas and happy birthday
thanks sweet heart i got holiday for an entire week this will be very crucial
oh i also got a date with a japanese girl next week so i am looking forward to that
i donât know details yet to be planned
lol this isnât my first date with a japanese girl the first one started ignoring after the second date i also went on a date with a canadian girl here she also lost interest after the first date
ya it could
oh ya how was it i love kbbq
it is awesome how you can find all you can eat bbq in toronto the ones here are kind of expensive but maybe i havent looked enough
the only that i have been to didnt have an all you can eat option but they are still quite good though
you can have a decent dinner for like 1500 yen
for like a family of 4
that is kind of expensive for a kbbq
you might be able to find something cheaper in downtown toronto
delayed till next week
nothing much honestly i just read a book and chilled
chinaâs crisis of success
it was very insightful how was your break so far you are going back to school next week right or wait you found your job at phreesia so you are starting coop
are you excited ð
it is excellent how are you
oh shieeeeeeeet skating ð® joydeep so pro
oh really i can give you a massage next time i am around ðð
oh poooooor joydeep tt
i am sad you are hurt donât you realize that japan is cool i am going to an ai meetup this friday in the googleâs beautiful tokyo office
and next month i am going to a hackathon in tokyo my computer vision model is getting better and better
lol we can keep chatting when we are both awake donât farewell me yet
i mean we can chat soon not right now obviously
well then goodbye joydeep
what why do i have to remind you when you already know this
ok when do you want me to remind you and also how are you going to understand this event if everything is in japanese in fact i might apply to this as well
i will go down there to hit on some girls
yo i never asked you do you believe of the existence of intersectionality in tech or do you have an example to explain why intersectinoality is important in the work place
that was a question on the application to the womens conference
lol
that is my primary goal but i would also like to listen to what they have to say for that question i actually refuted the benefit of intersectionality so lets hope they treat that as creativity
that is like forgetting ur girlfriendâs name lol
it is big enough for two of us ð
ð
yo it is mostly about career i dont know what i am supposed to be doing as a first year student
i am not in coop yet but i am gonna switch into software next year and get into coop what were you doing in first year
were you involved in extracurriculars were you in coop
did you have any side projects
did you do anything for the summer
an instructor for what i mean the summer after first year
oh cool
yo i think i am also gonna get killer grade too but from your impression how much does it actually help
it is my third
yes
i guess that difference does make us stand out
but like that is only in ottawa
it might be different between universities
hmmm ok i didnt know it was that bad for them
but ya i can see what you mean i probably wasnt that mature back in first year my previous first year i mean by the way are those interviews from your coop or you searched those jobs yourself
they got a huge selection alright well thanks for making me feel better
this holiday ive been pressuring myself to do some productive stuffs but halfway through i wasnt sure if what i am doing is important did you apply to google
yo i got one more thing to ask you this one is more immediate for the rest of the break i am torn between learning ruby on rails and progressing with my game design project
do you know any nice tutorials
i have windows installed on my mac and i primarily use windows
ok i will consider it i am looking forward to them tutorials i used this one written by a guy who wrote the easy enough to be dangerous series
but every time something doesnt work it takes me forever to troubleshootmaybe your tutorials wont have this problem alright i am looking forward to it
hey sorry to bother you but are you back from the store
ok sorry for asking i need them ruby tutorials very very bad
alright lemme check this out
thanks for the tutorials
ya there seems to be a lot of them never really understood the hype though
nope i guess i will find out once i do some ror
so ror takes care of the mvc processes for you basically
i see
its like you only use your creativity to code the framework will figure the boring shits for you
haha aint that nice by the way do the marks from the fall term really only come up on january 19
i only got back 3 of minei guess it is because of the large size of first year classes
sorry i meant 1 of mine out of 4 lol i wouldnt be complaining if i got back 3 of them already yo did you demo anything for your first cusec
alright i think i am gonna abandon ruby and work on my game then i will try to whip something up in the next few days
only one cusec per year
yo what kind of topics do students typically for choose for the lightning talks
interesting do they ever turn into a rant i mean you can choose any topic you want
thanks for the info bud i got a few topics i am thinking about yo are you allowed to have more than one lightning talk
wait that means there are only 6 presenters
oh really yo i want to ask you which topic is more interesting making video games for education or does facebook use make people sad
good point thats what i was thinking as well maybe next year i will do the one about facebook haha
i am at cusec now trying ta sleep
haha i aint sure i dont know even if i have enough stuffs to talk about
i actually requested them to pull me out of it
lol
ok sure thanks for doing this
alright man i will trust that you trust me yo for lightning talk do we have to use the slides we submitted or can we just use our own slides on our computer
you sent an attachment here you go
thank you were there any recruiters in the audience
nobody came to look for meguess thats that
ya i kind of noticed which is really surprising but it also makes sense by the way to follow up with our conversation i am interested in dealing with this luke person you spoke of
if i get a job in ottawa i will be
yup thanks for your help
i am honored that you would send me links to interesting videos
i actually gotta thank you though it is nice to listen to people talk about how pervasive video game is
my parents has been constantly telling me that i would bring shame to the family if i make products that make kids sit in front of computers all day
yo when you sublet uottawas room in the past did you post photos
i see
thats what i thought too cuz that would be too much work
guess no yo have you ever used r before
damn i need your help i am trying to create this data frame
i have a list that contains all of the column names
and i have this list that contains the data for each row
how do you put them together
it doesnt matter how i do it
the thing is i got over 400000 columns
that is why i want to iterate through it
i got them in r lists the data points are numbers but the columns names are string
yes
ok i will try
what is this one supposed to do
create a data frame with n columns and then you manually add data points
ok
what is the function that lets me add row
alright so that worked the first first now lemme try the second
dr  rbindbasketsdf cyour data
wait what am i supposed to do with dr
ok lemme try object basketdf is not found
ya
ok that worked
good that you helped me out here
these bioinformaticians want to see what i got before they hire me and they want to know if i can quickly learn stuff
so i spent like 8 hours so far learning r and i got to a stage where i can start clustering stuff ya i know thats how i got this far
i am surprised at myself for being able to learn this quickly
lol i still havent decided if i am gonna go compsci or software
if compsci offered me a ring i would do it
idont know
1000
lol
pride and joy means nothing to me but maybe to others it is worth something
lol
did you just call lucia have her head in her ass
dude manyou got a bone to pick against that shit
lol and you were the one who told me to keep my attitude straight about them when i went to cusec
to be sure though they are try hards
you sure it aint for any other reasons cuz i think there are other reasons and maybe your mind is playing trick on you
well for one you entered ibm with the biased mindset about these waterloo kids so the moment you see them not talk to you you automatically make that connection in your mind unconsciously or they somehow find you uninteresting
have you tried talking to them yo honestly
wait
did they literally say that
he is from waterloo
well you gotta give him props for being honest but damn son
lol you asked the center well talent can bloom anywhere that is my philosophy
if they think like that then let them think like that
well i got nothing to comment about that no more i will get a taste of it in the future i presume and i will take care of them my way
i appreciate your recognition i am gonna get back to work this shit is unreal
later son yo good night man thanks for helping me out everything worked in the end
yo the help you provided me got me the job so thanks for saving my ass
lol you are going to anime north i didnt know you were an anime fan
but like are you organizing because of your expertise in organizing events or because of your interest in anime
dude i didnt know you were into anime all this time
whats your favorite anime of all time
aaah good old code geass
they are making another season for it with lelouch in it
you mean the english va
not jun fukuyama
i see i have two favorites hyouka and garden of sinners
have you heard about them
hyouka recently got licensed so you might hear more of it in the future and garden of sinner is a truly niche series so less people know about it
which one
ya that one has a very distinct style that stands out amongst the titles out there yo i got a question for you
so like i am trying to decide how i am going to find a place to stay between september 2017  september 2018 2018 summer that is i want to know how you organized your residence in this past year
right now i am considering living in the same house as the girl we would get our own rooms possibly different floors but share the same kitchen do you think that is too close
thanks man
yo i need your help man i want to edit this huge ass text file on mac for data analysis but microsoft excel cant open it do you know of a good way of editing that file on mac
it is a text file tab delimited i believe
the thing is excel cannot open it because there is a limit to the number of rows it can support and that file i want to edit exceeds that row limit
i was told that there is a way to edit large files in a mac environment that cant be done in windows does that ring a bell to you
do you know if bash can edit files
i will try with sublime text thanks for the input man
lol that just actually worked
hey i got another question do you know what is the fastest way to remove all the lines in the textfile that doesnt have a certain string you cant do it manually because there are millions of lines
yes this is macbook pro 2012
i got it for free
from my uncle in chinois
ok i will look it up
so if i use perl then i wouldnt need to open up the actual file to do the editing right since i will be getting each line from a script
i dont understand why they said i need a mac for this cant you also do this in windows
why is that
but for this specific operation that i want to do now i should just use perl because for this specific task it happens that doing it in perl is easier
yo perl is already installed on mac apparently
alright i am gonna look into this shit you are saving my ass here
analyzing biological data i am working with the same people who gave me that interview problem that i needed your help for
thanks man i have been stuck on this shit since yesterday yo i got a question for you again is your mac 16gb ram do you find that large memory useful
so 8gb ram aint gonna cut it for you huh
as in might as well go for 16gb
aright thanks for the input how are things going
alright enjoy man yo i need you to remind me are there microwaves at cby student lounge
great stuff are you in school this semester
ubisoft
lol what are you doing there data analytics that company fucked up two of my train rides
so you are now doing electrical engineer work
so how can you optimize train with compsci is this like a new generation of digitalized train
lol i can hear your compsci promotion from 10 light years away
yo i got a question about summer courses
how does the sessions work why are there different sessions
does everybody finish before july so you still take all the courses at the sametime but they are just condensed because they want august for the holiday
i see yo i noticed on the uottawa homepage that summer semester technically ends on the last day of august oh wait that is only if you are in session d
ok yo i got a question about coop navigator did you find all of your coop jobs through the jobs that participate in the navigators placement system all of the coop jobs that you actually worked in i mean
why are there people telling me that the coop jobs here in uottawa are shit that person has a friend in waterloo and they apparently have way more jobs than uottawa in coop
but what do you feel about the quality of the jobs in the navigator
no my friend is in software engineer here but she has a friend in waterloo
haha dude i think i get where you are coming from and heard my share of stories about peoples arrogance from waterloo i dont need to work at microsoft or google
but i want to know whether i can find jobs that are challenging and good for my learning and growth are they under cs
is there an option to choose those categories instead of being stuck in engineering
yes i heard about that but people from the engineering faculty can apply to faculty of science jobs right
goddamn that shit so i am stuck with shit jobs now you know what i am not gonna worry too much i will evaluate the jobs when monday comes
you just said that good jobs are not in engineering so i am assuming that engineering has shit jobs
ok that was what i wanted to hear damn straight yo how many jobs do you recommend me to apply to on coop navigator i mean
oh right
so you can request to not get more interviews huh
alright yo dude all the craps you said about how the students in software engineering are egoistic turned out to be right lol
well it is not hard to ignore those kids
it is going to be a challenge
yo have you ever done anything related to machine learning i might need to do some this upcoming fall and i am looking for some introductory materials
great stuff i got to learn some high level materials for an interview next monday hey jonathan can you please send me some links to help me get up to speed with machine learning
damn son thanks for sharing
do you know anything that is like more higher level not the overly technical stuff you sent
as much as i appreciate them
kind of sql and nosql
i know about them but i havenât practiced them much yes
i will learn those during my spare time last semsster i learned i got a lot of thay
i donât know
well anything helps really and thanks for all this info
how much time did you spend on this before you could use the theory in practice
why canât you just directly jump into learning how to use them asking as someone new to the field
what is modeling in this case
i see
well i am gonna have to take into consideration what i am going to be doing in the future my timeline might not be so kind to me ya sure thanks for all this explanation
dude it is just a matter of allocating the right amount of time to study for certain things and i am also gonna get my iron ring
ya well you cant say that for sure
well i would have used that spare time learning the other half of things that i wont be able to learn from purely cs and trust me man i will have plenty of spare time
yo so this is abbout my game
you saw how my game has like mirrors and rooms right
i want to calculate whether a object is being observed by the camera of the player when the object is reflected off of mirrors
you can basically treat the mirrors as flat objects and light reflects at the same angle it hits the mirror
do you know of any efficient algorithms that does this kind of stuff
well in this case there is no refraction only relfection
you can treat the object as a cube and you would only need to detect one vertex of the cube
the thing is this kind of setup seems like a graph problem
assume the middle which x and y are you referring to
i think maybe you dont understand what i am saying effectively i just want a way to detect whether the player can see the object light intensity doesnt play a role
my original thought was i can create a network of mirrors like a graph problem but i was wondering if you have any better ideas
ok
i feel like that is really inefficient because it becomes n2 but maybe unity can handle that kind of stuff so maybe that is not such a bad idea
so that would be the way you would do it
but like i said the maximum number of mirror would be 6 so that reduces one dimension of complexity but i think you got a pretty decent strategy maybe the only one available
well anyways thanks for your idea i appreciate it
i appreciate your interest i hope to make a game that wont disappoint but development wise it is still very much at the infant stage
i will get back to you after a few months lol yo have you ever worked with ibm watson
i am trying to use it for my next hackathon and i want to get familiar with it
this is not analytics we are talking about just to clarify this is the discovery natural language recognition and others i want to use it to understand scientific papers do you know if it can do that
ya i ainât using it for analytics i want to build an ai that can understand scientific papers and use that information to answer scientific questions since you worked at ibm do you know anybody who knows this stuff
oh thatâs too bad yo have you ever worked with json files before
nvm solved the problem but i was wondering if there is an easy way to hide the object name in a json file like for example instead of ânameâ i wanted just
how will that get rid of the ânameâ
no i want to make the json look nicer it is a formatting problem
thanks for the info man a friend of mine just got rejected from seg switch for some weird reason and i am recommending him to go to csi data science
haha ya i was astounded too we seemed to have very similar hobbies too also the career choices we made how did you know him in the first place
yo is the lab report for iti1100 due today
did he not say it is due today like during the lab
ok
hey do you know where scr is
yes
i havent yet but going to do an interview next thursday how about you
a bioinformatician in toronto princess margaret hospitals cancer research division
i dont see why you are so amazed lol how was your interview
you are a very friendly person i think they will like you a lot
well all of the stuffs you saw me doing in cusec is my side project
but i havent had much chance to work on those these days this semester has been really busy because of iti1100 and this entrepreneurial course i am taking
gng4120
did you get an email for that as well no she is not which makes the course very disorganized lol
it was a mistake taking it
is she middle eastern
because there is only one middle eastern lady in that class and she is older than us
she is not in that class
maybe you are talking about gng21
that is the course taught by hanan are you doing any side projects interest in data science
biology
i see so you chose the biology stream of software data science pays a lot these days
lol good luck on that
where data science is where most of the money is at nowadays i think peng is doing data science a friend of mine is doing data science and he told me people pay a lot for that
ya he told me he knows a lot of theories in data science and thats what he worked on in google
do you have any interest in developing video games because i run a game dev club and we are trying to get people interested in it speaking of thati need to send out invitations to everybody
next week saturday ya that would be nice
would deeply appreciate your help
yes uogdc
yes that is exactly what i need to get on
httpsstoreunitycom get the personal edition httpswwwvisualstudiocomdownloads for the visual studio get the community version yo by the way i was at the startup weekend i was literally doing the exact same pitch i did in cusec
nope i had enough startup stuffs for this year if i am doing any more startup activities it will be on my own
do you like startup events you seem quite informed about startup weekend
hey game design club happening tomorrow it is at vanier hall 2095 if you are interested in coming a
no prob
have a nice weekend
it was fun we fixed some bugs i think next week we can create some crazy levels hopefully
lol sorry i meant this weekend i dont know who will show though exams are happening soon
lol a lab exam
chemistry oh ok well good luck on dat
hey i got a question do you need to enrol in courses during the term that you are planning to do a coop placement in order to account for the possibility that you dont get a placement
ya got the acceptance around mid may right now i am doing biology again in a hospital ð how about you
ya same here people here are quite nice and honestly my job is practically a biology job not much programming but this was the type of thing i wanted to try anyways because i was always curious of bioinformatics
i seriously prefer doing hardcore programming like my boss constantly thinks that everything is infallible she wants to make conclusions about stuffs all the time but she lacks all necessary information to be sufficiently accurate lol
ya
i certainly need to work on saying things diplomatically that is one of my weaknesses
but it doesnt change the fact that i am still working with a bunch of prideful people who think they are perfect that itself is hard to deal with
whatever
what do you mean
right so maybe i am being paranoid
true
lol you know what you are talking about you can probably tell i am not exactly a social person which is why i often get advice from more intelligent people like yourself on how to handle situations ð
most certainly i dont socialize that much
trust me we are not and please just leave it at that ð how are you finding your job are you enjoying the experience
not challenging enough for your intellectual brilliance i see
but of course you are
it takes something for a 25 year old to get social advice from an 18 year old it truly takes something special
lol
what does she do
oh shit she does biology
that is impressive
yo it was great talking to you but i am gonna get back to preparing my presentation on monday and thanks for your advice i appreciate it
and please try to have fun at work do something during down time like learning blender or something anyways later
ya blender
i have 11 right now
thanks how about you
3 tomorrow
that is a lot
solace ranovus and morgan stanley so what is the company that you most want to work for from the list of places you got interviews from
not sure there are many good companies
morgan stanley is probably the biggest one i got but there are some awesome local companies
ya unfortunate
i also want to get into ea games but they havent made a decision yet do they have to make a decision or can they just not even bother telling you that you are rejected
man i got so many applications i got 4 more space left for es ea
100
my first coop cant take any chances i got plenty of time to get into great coop places maybe next semester i will only do like 50
i have a friend in cs he applies to 10 places gets 10 interviews and get 10 offers lol
yes jonathan gratton
he is a very well known guy in the faculty cuz he is involved in a lot of organizing committees
ya he was there
weird you probably met him briefly
he is a popular guy
yo what kind of end of the interview questions did you ask the ciena people
random curiosities that i read about them like how flexible is the work from home option and how much interaction there is going to be with other coops from other universities
well it is not a good idea to do it more than once a week
yo come join me in ciena i am gonna work with then them
that is unfortunate did you get any of the companies you wanted
thats good
lol is there something funny
well now this is taken care of time to worry about seg
yes
but she only uses messenger mcdonald
macdonald
she doesnt have one yo hows it going did you find out anything about the quiz
whats 2
alright i am surprised there are other profs teaching this would have switched if i knew
that is pure bullshit just cuz he is knowledgeable doesnt mean he is a good explaner
hey has groza mentioned anything about a quiz yet
oh hell naaw do you understand what is going on i am reading the textbook and it is teaching me what the professor couldnât teach me in the past three classes
you sent a photo you are on deanâd honor list of software engineering
i am at the award ceremony for faculty of engineering
yup  you should have gotten an email
donât worry you didnât miss much and there arenât that many people here from out classes
it is gonna end soon
you sent a photo you sent a photo you sent a photo you sent a photo you sent a photo you sent a photo yo did you end up asking the ta about what is on the quiz
she told other people what that there are only two questions on the quiz
ok i will look at that then
how did you get your hand on this past quiz
lol a friend huh you got a nice friend
well anyways i really appreciate your contribution looking at the past quiz it is pretty much exactly what the ta told us today exactly like
ez 100 i think people in the program care too much about grade
everybodyâs asking each other how well they did on the test
sorry what i meant was that anxiety and stress is what i normally associate with grades other people may have different feelings about it like genuine curiosity but that still goes back to my point about people being too interested about grades well at least i find them to be because there are so much more meaningful things that you can be focusing other than grades
well the meaningfulness of grades will disappear for everybody who get out of school why not put focus on things that are not transient like grades
dont you find that number too low not to mention that 20 happens at the beginning of our lives
lol well it is a long time but it happens at the beginning i am all about the long term so mid and late game
there is good reason to learn stuffs but not necessarily putting all your focus on a number you can get high grades without putting all your focus on it is what i am trying to say
well that is true but i will also say that i have met some academically poor people who managed to get into graduate programs using their connections and outreaches and good references letters are also incredibly important
ya but then people keep asking me how i did on my midterms and stuffs lol
thanks for understanding
oh ya i didnât see his name on the deanâs list i wonder if he also doesnât try that hard anymore
ya he seems like the type of guy who just lives life the way he wants last time you set me up with him he told me i need to aim to work for valve lol
valve that is the biggest game development company in the world lol
i will see i might change my mind in the future lol anyways i am gonna sign off to study for the quiz
thanks for the nice little package i owe you one
yes
if you say so lol
hey whatâs up
you need to be a member of sfuo club
they give you access to the booking system ya
maybe my club does but i donât really interact with them that much anymore
what do you need the room for
which library room have you been using that smell like that
those ones on the fifth floor ok
no problem hey are you studying for ceg
yo do you know if they are going to tet things exclusive to chapter 1 2 and 3
lol like converting from decimal to binary or hexa
oh wait
well i m gonna trust that i can do those basic things during the exam without studying for them
alright thanks for the files i might look into them later just to check the format
yup but i donât read it though too wordy
ok can you give me your email
i will send it to you in like an hour i canât do it now
i think i just sent you the text check your email
how are you studying for this reading textbook now is probably the least helpful thing to do now
i am just looking over past exams and making sure i understand everything
hey i got a question for you about the coop are those quizzes from brightspace work term excellence getting marked or what
just did them and apparently i got 07 for one of them lol
what a load of crap that is lol
are you starting work tomorrow
where are you working again yes i am
but snow is falling hard tonight so it is gonna be hard to commute tomorrow
i think 9 to 5 weekdays
ya i am very much looking forward to this i just hope that the people in the company are not assholes but if they are i think i have a good way of dealing with them
they probably arent but thats pretty much all on my mind unfortunately phreesia seems like an interesting place to work at my work palce is very close to yours
haha ya
is that like a general statement or something that applies to the tech industry
because i have seen my fair share of assholes in research
and i know far more people who have dealt with assholes
but you know what people who are gonna manage you in this type of industry actually have degrees in management or human resource and that honestly helps with the culture
and plus i think you specifically will have a hard time finding assholes because you seems to treat everybody nicely and that helps with other peoples perception of you on the other hand i am a hard ass lol
you know what that is true gonna be fun dealing with that in the future
well the way i deal with them is by unleashing my superioer knowledge in business management and that they are overconfident with their abusive statements you just need to find flaws in their actions
to be honest i havent had the opportunity to try it yet but if anybody attacks me i would have a perfect position to counter attack because having to deal with bad people really scars you emotinoally
thats the gist of it
when i said counter attack i really meant explaining to them logically why the things they are doing is wrong
but yes that still might escalate the situation slightly because some of them wont listen to reason and quite honestly it is hard to resolve that type of situation without firing the person
ya it is a great skill to have you live around kanata right what is your commute like to your work place
lol yes if i didnt have a car but i have one now
so it takes me around 30 min
parents lent me their old car for the winter
hell ya
it is real useful but you also need a great teacher
thats nice very lucky when i was learning driving from my parents we were occasionally getting into fights in the car and we were yelling at each other lol
maybe asian parents most likely honestly
i heard from my best friend when he was practicing with his father he was getting his ass kicked
and he is also chinese
but you know what i ended up passing on my first tries for both g2 and g so it worked out in the end and thats where the ass kicking becomes useful for better or for worse
haha ya but there aint nothing you can do about it just gotta live with it
haha
lol thats a nice mother
she surely shows you lots of love
by the way how was your break
oh hell naaaww boring sucks
but other than that you didnt have much to do
it was boring for me to so i had to fill my time with my game project and the wifi at my home in toronto was pretty bad
i was only productive because i had nothing to do lol it was not a good motivation i remember you once said that you watched a lot of movies during one of the breaks was that reading week
i wanted to watch some movies too after being inspired by you but i didnt have any good ones
but they can be very boring if it doesnt suit your taste though they dont
lol that is a pretty good attitude
ya i do agree on that lol but i would have done it too if i had good things to watch just out of curiosity do you know about fatestay night the anime
ok forget i asked then cuz i remember you remarking about your name when quan vinh do and i were talking about it before our interviews
probably all the hayao miyazaki stuff
there arent that many anime movies that receive international attention
well i am gonna get back down to my game work right now
we might be able to meet up during work since we are so close
ciena is just one or two blocks away from your palce and i think there might be other people from the program working in that area
anyways later
hamza who is that
physical appearance
ok got it
good luck on your first day
thanks
yo are you doing the performancelearning objective thing for the coop
yes
like you are literally not gonna do it didnât they remind us to finish then by jan19
lemme double check but yes email it said to complete the supervisor and evaluation information before jan19
i am gonna set up a meeting for next week with my supetvisor
but like did you never have to do this before
so wouldnât you have expected to do it this semester
lol how can you forget anyways hopefully i will be able to start solving their problems soon
there is one other but he is more knowledgeable than i am 3rd year from carlton how has your first week been
that is a lot of coop
are you guys the only coops for your company
thatâs a tight knit community
haha that is nice food is always welcome
ye when you work these coops it just makes you feel how little spare time you have
when i get back home i eat clean up and rest and by the time i recovered i only have like one or two hours left until sleep time
less than when i was in school lol
yo did you get in uottahack
oh i see i am expecting a lot from your excellent organization skill i am gonna be real mad if it turns out to be a shit event ð yo how many people are attending this event
that is a lot of people basically as big as the one in western
are there any themes related to biology
it was good lots of good stuffs came out of it so it is a complete freestyle have you guys figured out the sponsors
but the sponsors must be interested in seeing hackers do something for the sponsors will they not and if that is the case then there can be category prizes
alright well i hope i can do some cool stuffs
i am gonna try to cure cancer at the event hopefully it works out
thanks
yo when exxactly does the hackathon start does it start on friday night or saturday morning
yo did you get the email about participating in faculty council meeting
i was thinking of participating but i am not interested anymore
i am not sure if it is worth my time maybe it is i donât know i should actually go lol
if i go i will need ur signature need signature from two people in my program
yo do you mind if we meet up tomorrow so i can get your signature also do you know any seg students from our program in your work place or today if you have time
lunch ð
lol
i guess we will just collect each otherâs signature
do you have somebody at your work place who is also seg
you can show me around your place
what time is flexible for you
ya for sure you got a microwave also free parking
ok great
ok thanks for the heads up
oh thatâs nice ya sure i can come tomorrow
yo you still down for today
can i come at 1230 instead of 1 got a scrum meeting at 2pm and do you guys have a cafeteria i didnât bring food today
lol i guess i will bring my own then
so meeting at 1230 is there any particular place that i need to be at to enter
ok
make sure you get the 2nd signature for me si tu plait
i just parked on the opposite side of the street from your office building at the first floor lobby
you can come any time you wish just let me know ahead of time
hey i got a question i need to ask you about coop report and congrats on getting in the council by the way
i actually just figured it out myself but i was going to ask you how you were planning to make your coop report âanalyticalâ as stated in the guideline
ya especially with four slots too
but i think this voting thing had a lot more to do with knowing people and gathering votes than the content of the statement i say this because everybody who got into the council are very established individuals in the community so more people would have voted for them not to say that your statement was weak in anyway but i donât think it was much of a factor
there is definitely a mix but i say this also because wei told me personally that he worked hard to actually get his friends to vote for him
i mean it doesnt matter to me whether what i believe is in reality true or not but i feel like i have enough indications for my perceived understanding of this situation
ya you dont need to believe me ð i just described how i thought of the situation
lol thats some nice coworkers you got
but i am sure you knew a lot of people from school who would have voted for you who had
you were the organizers for events and whatnot so that is not surprising
sort of like i need to wait for my academic advisor to give me my new course sequence because of me going to do an 8 month coop in september starting
yes
no i am going down to japan
i guess i havent told you
lol
well i applied for canadajapan coop program in january got in the program and i started applying for jobbs in the same month 5 in total
i will be doing research on humancomputer interaction using machine learning techniques
just an intern student
haha ya
like the moment i saw the list of jobs available i was like damn they got some nice choices i think my ability to speak japanese helped with the application as well as my experience and knowledge
yes i do lol good night by the way letâs talk another time
intermediate level all around i would say night for real this time lol have you been told when you can apply for summer courses or can everybody apply on april 5 apply as in enroll
yo if you do not mind can i take a look at your coop report from last summer for reference
thanks you are writing a 4000 word report this time right
ya that also sounds about right i am curious what you wrote for ypur last coop you mentioned it was very boring
i will find out after you send ð
fwang100uottawaca by the way have you been to the council meeting yet or has that not happened
four courses like usual for me how about yours
yup
cuz i have transfer credits
by the way got the coop report thanks a lot
that sure is tough gotta suffer like i have suffered
i was gonna ask you how the council meeting went
did you manage to voice your opinion in anything
figured
it is good i cant wait to get back to school though
i think i have done enough here in this coop
yup how about yours
i am managing there is like no rush to do the work but i am working as efficiently as possible given the amount of time i have
i add new features to java programs essentially
i am not writing anything new i am just adding onto what other people have wrote before
are you doing something similar
thats gotta be nice i wish mine was project based
but since you dont have much work now did you already finish most of your projects
i see
lol lots of students studying
lol thats the life of a student i am looking forward to the user interface design course are you taking that as well
ya lemme check you sent a photo lol i just realized i dont have any classes on monday i feel lucky this semester practically nothing on tuesday too how about yours
ok we actually got quite a few classes together gonna be fun hopefully
it is a sociology course focusing on the impact of technology on society i think it will focus primarily on social media
you sent a photo oops wrong item but i was gonna say that the content of your report seemed pretty straightforward but it had a whopping 3000 word count
we probably overestimate how much 2500 really is
once you actually put your finger on the keyboard you can type all day
anyways it will be an awesome reference for me really appreciate it
nope
i got a meeting at exactly 1pm how many people are coming
i wish i could let you guys come over but they got this security door that actually detects if more than one people enters at a time i think i will just ask security sometime today to make sure
i will go talk to them right now actually since it is lunch
possibly i am not sure you guys just wanna have a look around the office right
it honestly might be better next monday tomorrow will be rushed is that cool with you people
great stuff i will ask around to make sure so just bring your friends over on monday security isnt an issue
10 people  well when i asked the security he said that as long as they sign up and their guest tags or whatever is visible then they should be fine
i guess if they arent gonna walk around randomly then it should be ok if i had my own company this wouldnt be an issue by the way
ya nine people is kind of a lot you know what bring them in i think i can handle it
but how are you guys planning to get here drive
ya i guess it is not bad 3 min by car
20 min by foot
i actually totally forgot to tell you i am not even at work today because of the weather ð but ya letâs do it another time i am cool on wednesday
ok and so you guys are coming tomorrow right let them know that we got a cafeteria with lots of options but they close at like 2pm i think
ya sure come to the main entrance 385 terry fox drive how many people you got
alright
right lemme know when you reach parking lot
text me then 6472429878
it was my pleasure it is probably one of the prettiest tech offices around our area i wish i had given you guys a chance to get some gourmet drinks from the lunch room but oh well
it was long but i didnât bother staying i will go back another time
ya sure was it 2 or 3 men
alright cool lets do it just to let you know i wont be in school next week
yo where are you having lunch
where is crx
ya i knew there wasnât such a thing called crx just wanted to make sure do you also have csi3131 later is that your next class
lol please you ainât actually at crx though right
ok
well it isnât a big deal i wanted to hang out with somebody until 4pm csi3131 but what is your next class though
when is it no i understand i will be doing work too
ok well i will come over for a bit then is there a specific part of the building you are at
alright i will try to find you
yup lol almost out of batteries
ya i will most definitely do that next time did you finish your class are you still in the building i am about to leave for csi
aahh ok you probably arenât gonna miss anything important the lab for this class starts the week after next one yo whatâs ur lab time slot for 3131
wanna partner ð°
ð¤®ð¤®ð¤®ð¤®ð¤® is jannah from seg
you should introduce me to her next time if she is around i dont know who she is
yo i need ur help with qa have you done the tutorial problems yet question 1 provide two additional test cases for valid inputs covering equivalence classes not covered above
ya somebody told me the same thing in the seg chat just finished the tutorial too gonna work on the lab now
oh it was amazing i became friends with fellow students who are going to japan and on the last day i got interviewed by a reporter from the japanesevancouver newspaper
how are things going with you qa going alright
yo have you done the lab2 for seg3103 where are you supposed to get the date class are we supposed to implement that date class ourselves
lol i totally missed it i already had it downloaded in my folder did you already finish
just started myself and already needed to ask you for help
you know it is due on thursday right you sent a photo
ya it is a shame we dont get to work on it in the lab they want us to finish before the lab starts
ya you really shoud
nope will work on it more sometime today
great
got it
this is some good stuff we bought
should have kept it all ð
oh shiet sorry didnt see it doesnt it cost money to do etransfer
alright well you can send it to broodstarfrankhotmailcom broodstar shall accept your offer
ya got it yo have you already formed a group for seg3125 lab
yes if you know anybody who is working alone lemme know i dont wanna work on mine no more
ok thanks
havenât done it yet gonna do it tomorrow possibly or should i do it tonight you talking to me about it is kind of dredging up my guilt
that is why i am leaving it for tomorrow yo were you able to access the coverage setting for the second part of the lab
my pycharm doesnât allow me to access the coverage setting you sent a photo
yo can you just tell me the coverage statistic for question 3 by the way what is your asnwer for question 5 of the tutorial i think it is impossible
ooookkkk
thanks for your help
when it says 100 path coverage it means all combination of if statements are tested right
are those 45 cases where you cannot reach because the exception statements are stopping the code
ok well anyways it is impossible to reach 100 thatâs good enoigh for me
ya no problem one other group also thought it is today
fwang100uottawaca
i got your invite so much stuffs due in the next few days
oh well time to get to work yo i finished my part of the assignment let me know when you finish so we can combine our work
yo can i compare  answer with you for tutorial 5 you sent an attachment
hey are you done with your assignment can you be the one to submit here are my testcases you sent an attachment
awesome
thanks sherry good work watchu up to now anything planned on a sunday night yo do you still remember your experience from first year physics
i wanna do an interview for seg3125 projject and it revolves around physics physics classes but honestly i guess it doesnt really matter whether you still remember are you available to do an interview before friday
thanks lets meet at crx at that time
i am actually not even working on it cuz my teammate is taking care of it
can we meet at crx at 5pm tomorrow so are we down for today
10 min or 15 min
how much earlier
we can do it tomrorow if you are on campus
alright
ui lab do you even go to that i sure dont lol we will see we can do sometime next week
the deadline got extended so it is not a rush
oh ok
yes just had a nap
yo i shared with you the google doc for seg3103 assignment 2 i remembered that we actually have to submit assignment individually even though they say we can work in a group of 2 here you go
i am at home
whats up i thought i would be at school early today but i decided not to so i can have lunch at home i will come down maybe at like 3pm
tutorial
wtf
do we even have a tutorial for os oh yes we do i didnt look at the tutorial i dont think it is relevant for the exam
last person to finish submits and you are it you sent an attachment
did you take care of it
wasnt it due last night
nvm ok you sent a photo
havent checked lol i got like 50 that is pretty sick i guess i didnt know jackshit about the course
i am very sorry to hear that
do you now fail the course or what is going on
ya you better start studying for that shit lol
hoooooo damn girl we just got dunked on chaos dunk
yo for qa i will take care of question 1 and question 3 you need question 1 to do 2 and 4 and i figured you probably will start later than i will
hey how are you doing is everything ok with you for qa
ok
i do wanna say though be wary of your initial assessment of the straightforwardness of the assignment people seems to be having lots of trouble with it but i will say that they certainly do look straightforward on paper
oh ya i worked with mockito before so if you are confused about it i can help you out
yo how are your sections going
so you are using part 1 for your sections did my solution make sense
they are not the same test cases i mean technically they are not the same since they are testing different functionalities but the test data doesnt matter for them because those functionalities dont need test data
i am having a lot of trouble with part 3 others are having the same trouble too
setting up mockrunner correctly anyways what you need to know is that i asked for an extension for this assignment but i will complete my part with the assumption that there is nothing wrong my my setup
yo when you finish your section can you please take a look at part 3 i want to see if you can try to complete it
by the way i got myself on the right track for part 3 i exchanged some email with the prof and he answered my burning questions
the problem was that i was making too many assumptions about how the whole mockrunner mechanism worked and the important assumptions were incorrect but the way the assignment phrased the problem led me to a lot issues too
well i aint glad that this happened my time is precious and i spent at least 15 hours on just this one question
ya cuz i went super ocd on it here is part 3 solution completed you sent an attachment i also updated the google drive document the rest is up to you let me know if you have any questions
well i donât expect to get a 10 anyways how much of question 4 did you finish like you didnt attempt it at all or what is going on
alright dont worry too much about it i forgive you i have a lingering feeling taht my part one isnt right anyways so we are even ð
probably more ready than you are yo we got 100 on assignment 2 good stuff right there
yo whats up
i havent had much chance to do anything really but this weekend i am going to mount fujij that will be exciting
and yesterday i did some karaoke with my coworkers that was awesome
work wise i am pretty satisfied i discussed with my supervisor exactly what to do for the project and i think we both like its direction how about you first week of coop right
you were doing government stuff right
i am really surprised you didnt government last time like
dang i am glad it worked out for you
was it like this last time you worked at phreesia
what is the content of your work
excellent i am doing a lot of ml this time around
i feel like if you dont do ml in this coop you will fall behind a lot compared to your peers
ð is this like the first time i ever saw you this excited
maybe at uottahack too
i am loving the food here primarily the snacky food but the lunch and dinner are awesome too i eat at my company cafeteria they always have healthy and tasty food i will send you some pictures next time
the cafeterias here are very systematic i would say
like they try to keep it very orderly
it is a very beautiful campus but unfortunately i cant show you pictures of it because that is the company policy lol do you miss me
we are very distant siblings in many ways
well to be fair that can be an indication
when i meant fair i meant psychologically he probably dont think that far when he says random stuffs like that like most of us
you think that wei thinks twice
lol i am just being a savage
anyways good night i am off exploring the city now later
thanks hey hows it going
yes indeed
ive been doing the best i can for work it is progressing surely but slowly as for life everything is decent on the right track is the way i would put it how about you
oh shieeet
your work ends pretty early is that like a christmas thing
thats awesome you get to relax a bit more
i am going to get the a new year holiday but nothing for christmas
haha
ya people here care more about new year than christmas just a difference in preference from the west nothing that crazy
i actually didnt know we get christmas off until you jjust mentioned it ya i get like an entire week off
so how do you feel about your work experience this time around
even more that phreesia
i am happy for you ð
i didnt get the exact number until you mentioned it now
it has been good the other interns are incredibly friendly and we play like ping pong every week haha
yes for sure i have actually learnt a lot more than i did in any of my past coops
i wasnt shocked but there were certain differences between canada and japan that became more clear to me as i spent more time here like girls love wearing skirts over here
well not that i am complaining ð
how was your coop work content did you find it challenging and worthwhile
not at all people ought to enjoy work are you going to be in school next september
no i got another work lined up are you back in school during summer
no this time i am back in toronto
i wish i could work in japan but the only company that i got an interview from rejectsd með­ but i will be working in university health network
this researcher needed a software engineer for a deep learning and web dev project
he pitched me a business idea and i really wanted to hear more about it too lol
lol yes but i am cool with that we are still young now we got to everything in our power to learn and explore but honestly it is similar in everybodyâs case in seg
i wonât be in anymore coop terms after that but i got a free summer 2020 i will definitely work on somewhere then but i donât know where yet i am gonna miss it after i leave
you should definitely go there when you visit japan they really know how to enjoy themselves
i honestly havenât explored that much since i am not that big on sightseeing but i went to osaka and hakone so far those are the only places iâve been to outside of tokyo
well they are great here ð you sent 4 photos and of course you got the entire category of actual japanese food
lol
the first one i think are my coworkers the one that has the white girl
ya like they are all canadians because we went together as a program in canada
we live in the same apartment but everybody has a different room but it still feels very close knit i am very lucky to have them
all at the same floor ya lol this yearâs uottahack has some very interesting topics i wish i could come
what did you do to reach this stage
did you start with the unity downloader
at what stage do you get this error
well try installing it again
but it looks to me this is a purely visual studio problem so dont install visual studio for now just install unity
so unity is done
ok great thats all you need for now
ya sure
any account you create get the free version
oh shit soni forgot to tell you i thought you knew that we are changing to meeting every week
hmmm it is up to you do you want to join the clubs team or do you want to join my team the game the club is working on is pretty interesting
ya you can but it is going to be a little chaotic and i havent thought about how to manage it yet
you are supposed to select the rts tutorial folder and then open select folder
79 louis pasteur
just come outside the residence i will let you in
you better get ur ass over here before 1130 i am incredibly busy today and if you are then you might miss me if you are late then you might miss me
are you outside the building
walk further north towards laurier and you will find 79
you got to move back a little bit wait for me at the university intersection do you know where that is
can you walk further south
walk towards 75 now and i will intercept you on the way go
ya it is i am assuming iscaptured returns a boolean
why dont you just set it as boardijsetcapturedtrue i dont know why you are doing iscapturedij instead of true
dude you dont even know how a function works anymore this is some basic shit that you learned in iti1120
what is your problem right now i dont know what your problem is
yes you can you can set a point to captured
you are supposed to set the captured state of the object to true and the way that you are doing it now is not doing that
any other problems
thiscaptured  captured that is the only thing i have in that method
yes
you are welcome yo game dev club happening tomorrow if you are interested
dont come if you are not interested
we are not forcing you
the clib club
ok good
ya i cann tell you what to do
fss7035
lol yes same room
nice work
not many right now only 5 or so people are gonna show up today
what do you mean like how the development goes today
the gameplay mechanics today we are gonna put together all the assets in a level we are actually putting a level in unitu
yes we might develop more assets
we can already control the character
yes
ya the club is not very beginner friendly we wanted to have some tutorial sessions but the thing is you gotta pariticipate to get good if you dont participate you wont learn quickly active participation is key here
the concept is really easy here
if you are not coming thats ok but you gotta participate to learn anything and you gotta ask questions too
do you know scripting in unity
if you know scripting then you can help us yes coding
everybody can
then you have to ask questions try to understand
she is not coming today
she didnt do much
we are going to start at about 2pm
ya it takes time to get used to it
ok
yes why
why you asking me this question
you are not allowed to wonder you need to think
what were you thinking why does it matter if i am frank on pizza
ok son
undo redo
thanks
ok
11 13 33 31
ur welcome
you need variables inside model to keep track of the state of the game but game controller controls those variables
you just used that word yourselfwhat did you mean by state of game torus and diagonal
gamemodel do not control the view of the game it controls the state of the game
yes it contains the information of the game but it doesnt control it game controller controls everything
yes
where are those variables
ya
i am not talking about the buttons
yes that is right
so where are those variables stored
yes
you just do model  stackpop in your game controller and then make the views model the same
because when you do  stackpop you are only changing the reference in the controller the views model will still have the reference to the old model
yes
does this give you an error
did you change the model in both gamview and gamecontroller
i dont know what to do for you man there is not enough information for me to understand what your problem is gameview and gamecontroller
sorry but i can only help you if you show me your code your entire code not just a screenshot
i can help you on monday if you come to me but right now i am busy
in gamecontroller
pushing of clone model is only done in gamecontroller
i dont know what you are asking
i am free after 4pm
yes but i can only help you for a little bit i got other things due today
ok
yo does 1100 have a lab 6
how do you know
thanks for the info bus bud
are you coming to my dorm for help
ok where are you now
i am still in class i will be done in 8 min
i am coming now
as many times as needed
i am using if statement
i dont have a function for specific modes they are all handled using if statements
that doesnt improve efficiency by the way it just makes the code look better
contr
i dont honestly care about that
you can download the already implemented linkedlist class from the assignment document
who gives a shit
assignment documents are often full of mistakes just download it
if you do part 2 first part 1 is easierr but it is still doable
not too expensive
you call make a function call inside the function that you are calling the function
you can use that function as a helper function and create a separate function that do the actual recursion
you throw an exception
ya initialize the key
make an elem with that key and add that elem onto the list
we do have one but it is not very important
oh it is in cby a707 sorry forgot to tell you that yo i am actually sorry you should have told me you are coming
we didnt do anything we talked about what we will do next year practice unity
ya
3d
i am personally doing 3d the club is doing 2d
do you want to come with me after exam it is scotiabank theatre ottawa i will go to the one that is showing at 255pm 20 min bus ride from school
you will probably get it will you not
well our prof is personally gonna check over our test and she said she will be nice
dude dont worry man it is not a big deal even if you dont get a you should be more worried about your job opportunities
are you sure you are already in coop i thought that if you are in coop you start working this summer even if you are in computer engineering
ok just wanna make sure i dont want you missing deadlines to apply if you arent in coop
nope never did
did he say that i dont remember
didnt you do well on all of them
ok well i dont remember yo let me give you an advice
dont worry about your grades
dont spend too much time or effort on it dont spend too much time or effort thinking about grades it doesnt help you get higher grades and it can cause you a lot of stress
i have experienced this in the past and worrying about your grades is completely useless stop thinking about it starting now
yes please this will help you in the future
yo do you wanna meet up tomorrow to do some review for 1121 i am meeting with a friend
how did you find the exam
ya
you too buddy
nice
grade for 1121 is out
i got a
ye
you might that is possible if you think you did well on the final
oh thanks buddy are you back in ottawa
how are things going
it isnt man never too late i am doing good
i got myself a girlfriend
that is honestly the biggest thing for me this summer chinese
international student
ya we were in gng4021
oh yes i did i am in software now my coop will be in january
thanks buddy
ya i accomplished everything i wanted to achieve this year
interview is not hard if you are confident and knowledgeable
if you can boost your confidence a little bit more i think you can be fine
lemme tell you a computer engineer can do a lot in the first two years but you will be the most successful if you have a desire to learn new things
ya
doesnt matter you just need to have an attitude to learn new things dont htink about doing impactful stuffs but think about what you can do to help other people do more impactful stuffs
hopefully this can help you but it is also nice to have confidence in your ability to learn new stuffs
do you have that confidence
if you are doing online interview just dress normally if you are doing interview in person you dont have to dress super formal but definitely make yourself look professional believe it or not engineer is a professional career
it might be your next summer
you still got time
over the next several months you should do things outside of school to boost your confidence thats my number one advice for you you are intelligent enough to be competent in technical details
and you might have a lot of anxiety coming from the education system in china
speak your mind
i simply just meant learn stuffs that you enjoy
like if you are still interested in game development learn unity if you are interested in robotics then learn the fundamentals of robotics and how to make robots and make your own robots
welcome yo did you see my facebook profile cover image
the image of the kitchen ya i made that using blender
nono
that image is not a real kitchen it is a 3d model
blender is a 3d modelling software
i learned how to use blender after i left ottawa and it took me about 2 months to make that image
no
i am just trying to tell you if you enjoy your work you can do anything
and this is what employers are looking for the ability to learn quickly and generate meaningful product
anyways thats all i gotta say
ya i am off to work
see ya
not yet permanently i actually came back from ottawa just today from visiting my girlfriend are you back
ottawa  toronto today now in toronto
so what is up with you these days enjoyed your vacation
you can do that here in canada too but not the chinese food
have you considered varsity basketball playing basketball competitively
ohhh i see street ball is cool too
have you ever played against students from the university
so you destroy them easily lol street balls do take more skill than regular basket ball
i have no idea
i kind of gave up on the club
it is up to the rest of the group whether they want to continue
ohh nice
so you learnt unity
good start i am also making a 3d game
i will be working with adrian to develop this
there is no limit on the member numbers because we are not expecting many to join lol
but the thing is i dont know whether the club is continuing ohh you are talking about my team huh yes currently there is no limit on the member
ya you sound like you know more stuffs than last year
you dont need to force yourself you just need a desire to learn where are you living this time
close to school
i see i am outside of school too
yup
hahaha everybody gets girlfriend eventually
you should focus on improving yourself
you just need to live your life to the fullest being part of a society love your classmates love your friends
ok thanks what is your class schedule like
no i do not i want to do my own stuffs or sorry what did you mean work undre a prof doing a project with a prof
i will have to think about it i am doing coop next semester i dont think i can
and also i am just not that interested i am only interested in working with some profs in department of education because i want to make software related to education
yes
gamification
educational video games
but oh wait i might be able to do a coop with a professor who does education that will be interesting
dude it is not decided yet
cuz i still havent looked into the job market in the coop program they might not have this type of work
you will have to send resume yourself but for me i only need to upload my resume once and every employer in the coop program will be able to see it
yes anyways i am planning to meet up with adrian next week to discuss about the game
nice
i wanted to know what time you are available fp puzzle
anytime you dont have class i have no class on tuesday
what is your schedule for next week
only for next week when school is in the second week my tuesday is full
you know what we will figure out what time we are available later on right now is too early to talk about this i will talk to you later i am gonna watch some anime and write an email
and i gotta get my resume ready like you have
later hey are you available wednesday after 1130am
yo son are you available after 1pm
where is your last class
is that right next to the pharmacy
ok lets meet at cby in the underground lobby
gatineau
no why did you think that
it was hard finding a place to live with my girl if i didnt have a girlfriend maybe i would have gone there
yes
no i have the 2105 tomorrow at lees
yes
ya it is a big game are you gonna get it
lol you sure it is a horrible game who told you it is a horrible game i can tell you that is one of the best games i have ever played in my life narrative and gameplay wise
ooh it is a horror game not a horrible game horrible means bad
horror means scary
but yo this game doesnt have ghosts it is mostly monsters chasing after you
ya robotics and monsters
that is not the type of scary you should be worried about
let me tell you this son if you watch somebody else play this game you are gonna regret it for the rest of your life because the first time experience is very precious
but if you dont care about that 10 hours
lol did you play those games
this is a narrative heavy game anyways here is my suggestion
i need you to at least play the first stage of the game because i need you to experience the game control
oh nice on steam or pirate
yes sure
ya not really
anyways have fun with it
i am going to sleep now good night
havent tried
lol dide dude you are owning this shit show me this stuff on wednesday
why cant you test it
player transform is it not i showed you this afternoon
the mirror i think you are talking about is the main camera and main camera is a child of the player
yo i told you to ignore the mirror script that script is useless right now the scripts controlling mirror movement right now is in the controllercs
yes and the thing is not a mirror it is a phone
but the phone has the function of selfie that acts similar to a mirror
i am not sure actually yes it is around world center but it is not controlling the rotation it is only controlling the position of the phone
position is the world location of the phone center of the world is at 000
yes i want the phone to be in a fixed position in front of the player
no well it could be but at the moment that is hard to do without making your own character model because the scale of the player is not 111
if you think you can change that then you should do it and show it to me tomorrow
dont know yo son do you need to discuss anything with me today or are you cool
ok i am still waiting for you at cby
yo i need to correct something i told you before eulerangles is the regular rotation notation in vector3 notation quaternion is the one that uses complex numbers
next monday
i didnt know that and thanks for reminding me
we are not gonna have any meetings
yes
we are not doing any projects we are doing game jams in game jams you make games
thats all we are doing this year
we have no classes on monday
you will tell me what you need from me now soldier
lol i aint going
i am not full retard man
not precisely because it is retarded
done the interviews waiting for result
nope i had 15 interviews none of them are close to the river
i applied to 65 companies got 15 interviews
lol what do you mean nonracially based they dont give a shit if you are chinese or indian or black or white
thanks buddy
you should study and do assignments
i am swamped with midterms and assignments and i am procrastinating there aint nothing i am gonna do buddy yo how good are the people you play basket ball with
skill do you just play with random people
maybe i should join you one day
ya thats no problem man maybe we can play some days
you might go there and meet some people socialize thats about it and you play other video games of course but it is mostly a fun event for gamers
not going i have class during the whole period i might drop by for a moment after my class finish early but i wont be there at the beginning
to be honest i am not the most socializable person neither and i would only go to events if there are fun stuffs happening there that i know i would enjoy
you just need to be outgoing dude dont take yourself too seriously
you donât each node is only a representation of a string but they donât store the memory of the string
yes
donât use substring use an integer to keep track of the index
index of the string
yes
did you need something from me son
nothing much how about you
how are you liking computer engineering
you will hate comp eng in the future i believe
do you like hardwares
there was somebody in the game dev club last year who was in computer engineering but he wanted to be in software
he was more than second year
no he couldnât lol and he was complaining that he didnât make the switch earlier
i am only saying this because game design needs software and doesnât need much hardeare hardware
right
so maybe you will enjoy computer engineering if you do robotics you should go to japan if you want to do robotics they are making robots for sex
lol how do you know that you never experienced sex
i got into ciena in kanata i will start in winter
i am gonna earn like 11000 in four months
thatâs my loan from last year
i am gonna pay off my loan first
ya
no loan is money i borrowed from government to pay for my tuition
well i am not poor enough to do that
lol diligent boy later
you can google them i canât tell you now cuz i donâg have my computer in front of me
oh one is my previous job and the other one is vida
lol i am pretty sure i am unqualified to be your reference but if you want to put down my name you can sure do it and i will try my best if they talk to me
please call me vice president of the game dev club if you call me leader i wonât be able to explain myself
fwang100uottawaca
i donât know what tier is
at this point you are gonna have to stay in school for one more semester sorry one more year if you change program
if you meet the qualifications you will be enrolled in software next fall
why are you suddenly interested in it
to be honest the courses that we take are not really that interesting i recommend you to not judge your own skill level by the courses you take it is not dependent on courses
you will learn most of the important skills you need from working in jobs and personal projects
i used to think so too but i recently realized that the basic knowledge will be trivial once you start working
sure the basic knowledge will help a little but 95 of your learning will happen on the job but it is taking us an entire semester of course to learn those things that could be learned on job quickly
at this moment if you switch program you will complete your program probably one year later and that is something you should avoid but they dont offer very little practical benefit
first impression
well there is certainly that but how long do you think your degree can market you for at that point it wouldnt matter whether you graduated with bachelor of social science or software engineering
thats what i want you to think about if you can change your program without delaying your graduation i think it would be good for you
exactly
you gain much more from working than from being in school i can guarantee you that but that being said you should do more personal projects to increase your marketability dont just rely on your academic achievements
ya do that
have fun with that buddy
0 238 41 means edge 0  238 has weight 41 yo which class are you in
fucking hell
i want to make a partner for assignment 4 so i dont have to work on it anymore
but people needs to be in the same class
oh wait we can form groups with other class cuz all three classes are in the same group for brightspace
i am trying to form one
are you going to get 100 for me if you are then we can do it
what can you guarantee what do you usually get
lol then you are cool lets form a group yo go on brightspace and go to csi2110 and join group ga4 29 you sent a photo
do it now
what the fuck what do you usually get
good enough
get your ass in the group
where the fuck are you
when you enter the csi2110 do you see a tab taht says group
click on the 3 lines at the top left
ok great stuff lemme send you the document you sent an attachment i have already implemented the graph and i completed question 2 i am working on question 3 now
once you understand how the whole thing works do question 1 i didnt do question 1 because there is some confusion surrounding it that the professor hasnt covered yet you will be entirely in charge of question 1
good i am gonna finish up my part of the assignment by the time you read my code
2 days or precisely less than 10 hours
i am the best programmer this world has ever fucking seen
how do you know that i am curious
lol well you can change it into a static method to make it work lemme give you the latest version of my code
you sent an attachment no man
from now on you are gonna modify my mistakes implement your part did you already implement q1
ok then take the latest version modify on that
are you saying my readline doesnt work
are you saying that my readmetro doesnt work
lol
stationid is converted to integer class integer not int type
yes that is how it is supposed to be
int doesnt store any 0s that are not necessary
ok
yes it is
what question do you have is this about confusion around travel order
this is why i skipped question one
my friend asked the prof the same question and she said she might change that question
i recommend you wait until she give an announcement
if you want to do something comment my codes and understand what i did question 2 and 3 are already done they are correct
ya
go to the main function and you will see that i used graphalgorithm
go in graphalgorithm and look at the algorithm that i made understand what i did and comment them you can do that for me
hey look the point of me partnering with you is so i donât have to worry about this assignment anymore so i would appreciate it if you can do the rest of the assignment
but if you are having trouble with some parts i can give you advice but honestly since you often get 90s you can probably do this on your own
ya just do what you can anyways i am gonna sleep now later
clarification for question 1 has been made it is an incredibly easy implementation
yes use graph traversal and igonore all the edges that has weight 1
you sent a photo you sent a photo yo these are photos of the answer that a friend of mine sent me for q1 of the assignment
no
well looks like you got it
so maybe you can start working on documenting the project start adding comments you think you can do it
what code do i need to send you i sent you my code a long time ago did i not
you got dat right son or if you dont understand my code just comment your part and then send me your version and then i will comment mine if you dont understand what i did
you need them both one has 3 arguments the other one has 4
one is for q2 the other one for q3
yes
the one you highlighted is the line where it prints the traversal time
in line177 it uses entry therefore we need to use entry again that is not my code that was the code provided to us in the lab
do you need me to do something or did you finish your part
ok did you comment all your code
ok create a document for the assignment like mentioned in the instruction and send me the code
you must submit your java code plus a documentreport pdf file describing â¢ your chosen data structure classes attributes and methods â¢ high level description of the algorithms you use to answer the questions in part 2 â¢ examples of outputs for answering the questions of part 2
ok thanks i will look over it
ok
yo zone
yes actually i cant access brightspace or uozone
you sent an attachment dude you did not comment anything in the new functions you created you didnt make any comments can you please fix that
i saw like literally 2 lines of comment for your new functions that is nothing and it is not adequate have you not done commenting in iti1121 how did you do comments in that class
yes it should be very thorough and formal all i saaw was typcal dfs like wtf is that shit
you need fucking details finish that and finish the document and then send it to me when you finish
i am sleeping now so later
dude you didnt explain the data structure and you didnt include any example outputs finish those before you send them over to me
did you also look at your code
startprint printline removeedges
the other two are yours though
and dude please use the version that i sent you i fixed many things in the code in the version i sent you
the one that i sent on friday 1156pm and please explain the data structure
yes what did we use to model the graph
yes adjacency goddamn map you need to explain it
can you pretend like this is your own assignment and think about how to do this stuff on your own
yes please and remember use the version i sent you
yes it shold be removed and also if it is possible can you see if you can try to get my functions to print the numbers of the stations instead of their names
yes the idea is to change the way we generate the graph instead of keeping the name of the station keep the station id when we read the text file
for question 2 and 3 the printing is done differently than from the way you printed question 1 try my suggestion first to read the stationid instead of the name
yes i believe that will work
oh wait
use stationid instead of stationname sv  sgraphinsertvertexstationid see if that change sanything
you tested with question 2 and 3 as well
ok you know what just take care of your part i will take care of the printing thing
i will take care of it you finish your comments
yo how is the project going are you done
fix what
i just need you to comment your code i will take care of the testing
hey i think we are done with the assignment forget about the test cases some of them are not correct do you want me to do the submission
ok so you think you fucked up the algorithm if you think you fucked up the algorithm then you are gonna have to fix it
you mean our code generates the same answer for part 2 and 3
yes that is what i am talking about the test cases they gave us say that part 2 and part 3 should generate different answers for certain inputs can you give me an example take a screen shot
i mean 3 is not even part of the path between 0 and 288 so of course having a 3 wouldnt affect anything so n1  0 n2  288 is the same as n1  0 n2  288 n3  3
so i can do the submission
if the professor doesnt give us full mark on this then we can go complain about this
you know what i am gonna give it to you to submit i dont want you blaming me for any bad marks we get
this is the final version from me you sent an attachment you can do whatever you want with this and you will be the one to submit it
yes please
i have no more responsibility for this project
the test cases are wrong not reliable
no you will submit it do it i am not doing anything anymore
good boy
i donât need references
6040795
good boy so the answer that i had for question 3 was incorrect i misread the assignment
ya i am fixing it now
did you make any modification to the java file
if you did i can work from that version ok i will work from my version then
so what
dude i need to ask you one thing when you were doing q1 did you take into consideration of the stations that are connected by edges of weight 1
so is this the version that you submitted
so does this new version give the correct answer for question 1 like checking with test cases
ok great i am going to modify the code to be used for question 3
i just fixed everything so now our results matches exactly with the test cases
ya
ya sure you sent an attachment
hashtable contains all the vertices that are unavailable it is easy to search using a hashtable
they are not global variables so they disappear as soon as the function finishes
you put it as a global variable before but i changed it for you
you sent an attachment this is the new algorithm doc i still want you to organize everything you have my code you can make the final submission
yes the doc i just sent you has the correct examples
i guess so i want you to check everything over this is the last time i am touching this assignment i dont want to ever deal with it again
ok that looks good son
you dont need to tell me that soni know how good of a job i did but yes i did a great job
ok i am sorry thanks for your praise
hey son do you remember the code that you wrote a while back for the poltergeist game that helped to rotate the mirror according to the location of the table
send the controllercs
ok thanks thats exactly what i needed
was this semester too tough on you that you couldnât work on it by the way i fixed the bug you encountered before
well donât we all we should use version control when we work on this in the future
like github
it is only the first day nothing exciting so far
i am just setting up
yo nigger what is going on with you these days i might need your help again for programming my game this time we are gonna be serious
what do you mean a little bit you canât help a lot you will mostly be debugging
do you know how to use version control
bitbucket github
do you know how to use github
well it is time for you to learn how to use version control i need you to make an account on bitbucket we are gonna be using that instead of github
they are very similar
ok do it
what how do you get a coop
apply to jobs
are you looking for a job now
right so what is your problem
well you should have applied to more i applied to like a 100 of them it doesnt hurt to apply to more in your case
it doesnt really matter they are looking more for your personality and past achievements than requirements because people can learn new things while they are in the job
you will get at least something but it might be very mundane and apply to as many jobs as you can is it too late to apply
you still got round 2 the coop program here takes care of you pretty well apparently so dont worry too much about it
what are you trying to show me i dont see anything
ok good for you for finding it oh ml and dl
that is interesting thanks for showing me this how are things going with you havent heard back from you since last week
did you get rejected from all your jobs
you might get 1 or 2
but ya definitely do some stuffs before the 2nd round to improve your resume i see it is unfortunate
i can send you a copy of my resume
you sent an attachment
oh wait you sent an attachment look at 2018 not 2017 2018 is my latest
oh um i did use campus template lemme see if i can take some screen shots
but honestly this recent one got me 5 interviews to work in japan
so that one is about as good as the one on portal
ya
this is my template resume you sent an attachment what is that university
i got it from applying to cjcp i heard about cjcp from the japanese club actually on my first day there was this girl who came back from her internship in japan and that was because of cjcp
oh i see is that in kyoto or wait osaka
all of my interviews are in kyoto which is unfortunate
i wished there was one in tokyo but there wasnt any good jobs there
i havent gotten back any results i will know probably next week around this time
ya it will slightly but i dont really care i always wanted to work in japan and this is my chance
i know you are jealous son
but you know what this is because i worked hard last year to improve my resume
ya it is hard for sure
you got to build up slowly
take initiative struggle to reach to the top
you need to do everything
attend club events personal projects talk to professors talk to people and apply to jobs even if you might fail
attending clubs shows your proactiveness like people love people who are vicepresidents or organizers for events because it shows leadership and sociability
and putting hackathons or game jams on resume shows you are actively engaged in your professional ya
programming events
as in software network
what subtitle this is how i made my resume
i made a template resume according to their recommendation got it approved
then i immediately changed it to fit my own style
because i dislike their template ok sure
i would mainly modify your wording you can put down some good stuffs on your resume but the way you worded sound weak
when does your round 2 start ya it doesnt make me feel like you are a strong candidate
you have a lot of content but they needed to be worded better it would be nice if we can talk in person because i do want to help you maybe we can meet up sometimes
i am free during the weekend and after 6pm on friday i got interviews tomorrow and thursday
ya sure we can do that but you are gonna have to come to my house though where do you live
49 rue sainthenri can you give me your address
ok we will directly edit on your coop navigator so bring your computer
yes
yo if you want we can talk over skype about your resume instead of having you coming over since it is so far away but it is your choice
ya the weather is bad too
sure
why would you want to do that
yo can we talk about resume tomorrow i donât feel like doing it today
ok great are you still interested in helping with my game project or no there is no pressure i am just curious
do you have bitbucket
tell me your username so i can add you later
wtf is this shit i canât see jackshit in this picture
ok i just added you to the repository once you are in checkout the development branch
letâs do the resume at 9 am
ok choose your time then
ok
yo whats up i totally forgot about you just now are you ready
do you have skype i prefer skype or maybe we can use google hangout
add me ftwdullsword thats my username
are you interested in giving me access to your account to modify your resume
if you can format it nicely then i can
ok great i wont steal anything you can rest asure
ok sure yo in your communication what is this sports shoe physics thing
what did you talk about in that
ok dude what the hell is tcp
ok just to let you know i am changing a lot of your resume it is going to be hard to go back to your old version after i finish editing you are ok with that right
ok what computer skil ldid you teach old people
ok i am gonna take a break for now but you can see that i heavily modified your skill section i am trying to keep your resume content in 2 pages
you want to keep it under 2 pages so that reviewers can quickly see what you have done
i also kept it concise you were repeating some information and you were adding unnecessary information
i know my friend who has like a lot of pages on his resume in coop
but the reviewer probably only looks at the first few pages
it is generally well believed that people should keep the resume length to 1 page no problem for those pending jobs you applied to do you think you will get any of them for interview
i would apply to more jobs than just 50 especially for you
while i am taking a break i would recommend you to put down as much information as possible into the work section things that you have done in detail
its ok let me know when you finish
well if you can code in xxx then you are proficient in it it is your job during the interview to assure your employer that you can master new skills quickly
the point is that even if you dont think you have strong skill now you are confident that you can master new skills during the job i am sleeping now good night
good luck son apply lots jobs
ya i use a docker for my work but i dont really know what it does and i dont know what is jenkins did you find a job
what is your overall coop status right now think you got offers
the offers doesnât come until the last day of coop interview cycle but if you at least have a few interviews you got a chance be confident in yourself
dont be nervous think of the other person as a kind person who is trying to understand who you are and just show the other what you are capable of no judging
great stuff man nokia is a great place for you to start off at they got an office here in kanata
dont worry about competition show what you are capable of and show your confidence
how did it go
that is too bad maybe next time
they told you straight up that they wonât give you the job
but you just had the interview did you not
i see if you have more interviews then you still got a chance when does the interview cycle end
well you still got time you can get a job on the last day possibly that is possible i can take a look at your resume again this weekend
well i am offering you this option if you need it
where is that
whatâs the company
lol when is this
well good luck if you get a job there i know of a good rent place close to that location
bilingualism doesnât affect anything if they are interested enough to interview you then that means they donât care much for bilingualism
ik
well that was the same when i accepted my current job i didnât know jackshit about any of the stuffs they are doing but i am still doing well in the actual work
so i would recommend you to not worry and tell them that you can learn them rather quickly
yes
not really
you gave up on looking for a job this term you will try applying for coop in the future
how many did you apply to
i would have applied to more if i were you
how many jobs were available
i see that is unfortunate
good luck next time
you can sharpen your skill during that time
nah you wonât do that much better in software
take some courses on machine learning too possibly study what you enjoy and get better at it
arenât they the same thing
well i am learning both of them i believe
there are some good courses on udemy i am sure i will take them over the summer
maybe i will check out the mit one yoo too
you can learn by just scouring the internet but if you learn from official sources it is much faster basically buying time with money
but if mit open courses have free ones then maybe you can look at those as well
i am going to first read this book called the master algorithm that is a good introduction to beginners and it gives you a lot of new ideas on what you can use machine learning on
i will talk to you later
it is an event where you form a team to program something it typically takes around 24  48 hours
they typically have a team forming channel before the event like a slack channel or facebook page and yes some people live overnight most people live overnight
i think it is a great place to boost your resume
i am sure there will be quite a few of them but they are probably not hosted by universities
lol really why
are your courses going to be ok are you sure you dont want to switch to computer science
software engineering itself can be boring to some people
i am also finding it boring but it is ok for me because i will study on my own things that i am interested in
i think you will learn much more skills in cs that will be helpful for you to get a job software is good too but the jobs are not as interesting if you do a cs degree
sorry i meant the jobs in cs are more interesting than software engineering cs is where the innovative things happen
what do you mean boring
i think you will find that to be a good thing let me give you a life advice
your life will not be very interesting if you focus purely on your job and career you need to diversify your knowledge
i know that students from china are taught to focus purely on their jobs and studies so they have very little time to do other things that are actually interesting
having 9 noncomputing courses is your chance to diversify that get the fuck out of here with that shit i know how it is in china
and you complaining about 9 noncomputing courses is proof of that
if i were you i would gladly take that 9 noncomputing courses there are so many interesting things in this world that is not related to computing and you should appreciate that
you know what that is true
then software engineering might help you with that
but you also need to know that there are a lot of people who find jobs in software engineering field without being a software engineer
and they use their spare times to learn on their own
so like you should focus less on the course works if you want to look for a job and focus more on your practical skills
now you are realizing that hardware is complete shit
can you like graduate faster in cs
so will you graduate faster in ce than in cs or seg
wtf how seg is faster than ceg
i am pretty sure you will graduate faster if you stay in ceg right
yes i am
lol ok
you really need to focus on your practical skills before anything else i think and add more achievements in your resume having high grades isnt enough nowadays
if you include one small line about unity on your resume then yes it wont help
it only helps if you can express all the different experiences you gained from learning and using unity this is the same for everything else
me
you should do what interests you and spend time on getting good at it
and tell people what you learned and experienced from it in your resume what kind of interesting problems you solved
ya think about everything we talked about but honestly a good start would just be to learn something new and use it to solve an interesting problem
httpswwwudemycommachinelearning you should take this course
if you completely master the content of this course i can guarantee you you can find a job somewhere only 20 you can spend just a few days on this
related to what
nah i dont i only have game dev now i will go into ml after i come back from japan
ya i can
i will be back from japan next year may
from september till may yes i wont be in school
i am gonna go now talk to you later son
um you sent the wrong person dude
lol if you want to switch program now is the time to do it
you should just listen to me buddy i know exactly what you need to do to succeed in this world
get yo ass to the front of the class
just got invited to one ð for project
but we can form a group for lab or assignment i have tuesday lab
ok we can do anything
front row seat
there is a spot beside me if you wanna come
yes
ok
oh is that right
does he have good review didnât you do shit on seg2015
i saw your grade for seg2105 and it was like c or some shit
ok
which partners are you talking about
no they are both seg they switched from biochemistry
they switched last year
they switched a long time ago
yo you got a partner for csi3131
nah i dont
is the first lab this week
ok ya send the email oh wait when is your lab
friday
ok you send the email 6040795
tianren wang
yo how much csi3131 was covered yesterday
ok thanks
lol i will see i will go back to school next week
yes i did i am in vancouver now to prepare to leave for japan in september
well thats unfortunate maybe you can switch to csi where the course sequence is less strict
you should have thought about this a lot earlier but lemme tell you if you manage to switch to csi you can still enjoy a good program
ok then you should do it
i am surprised too to be honest the people who switched from biochemistry didnt seem to have any problem
they finished two years of biochem
i know seg people switching to csi
csi is still good yo what have we done for csi3131 so far
any lab or assignment works
ok great
i am actually having on top of ucu building you can come join me if you want
ok httpcatalogueuottawacaenundergradhonoursbsccomputersciencedatascienceoption this is what you should look for
then cant you switch to csi and just take those courses isnt that how it works data science is not a program it is a specialization of csi program
you know what go talk to your advisor
ya but i ainât going we already submitted the group did we not i thought we can do that stuff online
are you there now
sorry i should have came too you should have asked me earlier
but yes please submit the lab i will also look into it later just to know what is going on
yo for csi3131 did you have to install cygwin
yo what did you submit for this lab
dude how am i supposed to complete this if i am doing this lab with a mac cuz mac doesnt have cygwin and the things to submit requires cygwin does it not
ya but like so do you have mac or windows
so how are you completing this lab
but imagine if i am doing this lab i have a mac i cant follow any of the instructions because they are based off of cygwin
ya
which commands
it first asks me to do ls
ok i see so it is not dependent on cygwin
do you understand step 4 of b
so what am i supposed to type where am i supposed to put them in the terminal
ok
do you understand what is include stdioh
ok clang error no such file or directory âo clang error no such file or directory helloworldexe have you seen this error before
does it matter where you save the helloworldc
dude did you use this command gcc hellowworldc âo hellowworldexe
i saved it in my home directory but it is still giving me errors
i got the gcc helloworldc working you sent a photo
my commandline thinks that o is a file name
if you send me the c file then i can submit
i just submitted it will not be marked so it shouldnt matter whether it is correct why do you need me to submit this
why are you running linux vm
cant you turn that shit off
ok whatever man you can explain yoruself next week when i see you in class for now this is done and over
yes i know exactly what i am going to do
did you know i pulled out of my previous project team they were going to do web development but i have no experience in that field
so i decided to work on my own on a unity game
physics educational game
i see guess we are competitors huh
yo you are coming to the lab right
get your ass over here i am already in class yo i am looking at the csi3131 lab do you know what these lines do waitstatus waitstatus waitstatus they are line 76  78 in joinenonec
faaaaack
i submitted lab 2 you are responsible for lab 3
lol i would appreciate it if you dont send me this kind of stuff that spoils the story
i know but usually do not watch previews
thanks
oh fucking hell son what did you guys cover today i am reading the textbook instead
excellent
ainât got none
it was in the sample they mentioned they used the mockup from phase 0 so we were supposed to have a mockup a long time ago
well i did it is probably a good idea to show them yours
yes i am cool
you are more than welcomed to look at it as well you sent an attachment lab4 is completed but the submission folder is not available now because they delayed the deadline
ya i know i saw you as well
can you upload lab4 when the submission folder is ready ok great so everything is down to you now
yes
i used monitor
did you read the section of the text book on monitor
i did
monitors uses semaphore you can implement a monitor with semaphores
yes i am not entirely sure if my answer is correct i just followed what the book did
yes sir
no they donât
they keep waiting until they get their required ingredients
yo you took care of the submission for the csi3131 lab right
ok good congraturations
what i dont understand this bullshit they never specified any requirements i will go to the lab tomorrow and ask them do you understand the problem
you have to know
this sunday
no i just used html css and javascript
yes
80
you want to be friend with the asian girl i was sitting with today
oh that other girl i was walking with after class i mean next time if we all happen to be close by i can introduce you to her
her friend which friend are you talking about
was that lady there today
but you are also interested in the girl i was sitting with today
i dont know much about her honestly she seems energetic around me probably because she feels comfortable talking with me
she probably just dont know who you are honestly
final version httpstianrenwanggithubio check it out man
it is so fucking good even i am proud of it
thanks for trying it out man i hope my presentation on monday wont disappoint
dude i know i will get 100 i dont need you to tell me that for me to be confident
which girl the one who was cold towards you was there i donât know who else you are talking about
today sorry i donât understand you
you need to come see me
yes
you were talking about the girl who was chatting with me in class and sherryâs friend i donât know which of sherryâs friend you are referring to
yes i was walking and chatting with her after class
but you said she is not the person you are interested in
she is in seg
you are interested in being her friend i thought you are interested in her friend not her specifically
who is her friend i dont know who you are talking about
i am by myself
yes i have her
sorry what
ashley labell or meina the asian or the middle eastern girl
the one with glasses
her name is meina but i cant find her on facebook you should be able to check the list of people who went today
i talked to her a few times she is very friendly you are interested in her
interested in what way romantically as a friend i am curious why you are interested in her
please tell me
i guess you just gonna have to talk to her then huh you wont have much chance though after this semester i think she is graduating soon
i remember she told me she is 5th year actually
you really need something to relate i saw you in my class blah blah bblah
dude shut the fuck up man dont bring that anime shit when you talk to these people they dont like anime
i have no fucking clue dude what do you like about her dude she is outgoing
lol dude that girl you have a crush on sent me a friend request on fb
lol httpswwwfacebookcommeinaoria she has a boyfriend though too bad for you son
i looked at her facebook page and she has photos with her bf
yo i will talk to you later
hey have you started working on the lab yet
well you better start working on that shit if you wanna pass os
i can do all the entire lab you donât need to worry about it no more
what the lab program
i used intellij to compile i didnt go through all the command line bullshit
dude did i not tell you that i already completed everything including the count algorithm i already submitted in fact but good for you for completing it it will help you learn
you can download it from brightspace
chantal
the same grade as us right she is chantal i believe she has a boyfriend though
ok good hello son how is your school life
it is average i cant say it is going all according to plan going according to plan is good
i go to karaoke often with my friends
i climbed mt fuji yes they are
yo i wanted to ask you about your coop are you using the coop navigator right now
yo i will talk to you another time i gotta sleep now
my dear brother how are you doing i forgot to check on your and yes happy new year
waiting
lol why do you think you are wasting your time you have nothing to do during break
javascript dude i am doing the same thing
lol
how was school
dumb
right i will be careful about it have you found a job for the summer
oh nice congrats man i am very happy for you
what job is this
what do you mean you are not quite sure i meant which company
oh shieeeett that is in kanata
i used to work next door at ciena
the transportation to that region is really inconsistent i was really glad i had a car with me because otherwise i would have wasted hours of my time everyday
is this a 4 month coop
it is not a bad thing can you extend the work term
i wonât see you during summer cuz i got a job lined up in toronto i will be back in september though and from then on my courses will be the regular timeslots
so do you graduate in like 15 years
my last semester is 2021 winter
most students would have finished schooling in winter 2020 anyways man i hope you do well in your coop term
react node and angular are all incredibly important frameworks
if you can master them then you will be a valuable engineer
you and i need to work together on something after i come back in september
something interesting building a website that solves a problem
yes that is what js is good for
yes
have fun
thanks yes most definitely you will hope you are having a good time too
ya the food is nice
nah just the free seminar food ð
i think there is one i saw you in the friday seminar last week or was it wednesday i forgot there was one last tuesday from 45pm in the auditorium food after that
actually i didnt get anything either
ya that is like an overwhelming amount of them yo sorry about my lack of responsiveness this morning i was frantically fixing a bug on my computer and finally fixed it about an hour ago
ya it is especially stressful when i am being managed by somebody else
i will be coming now
ya we got max 2500 char and hell ya i have started that a long time ago it is in editing phase now but my boss is busy with other stuffs as a result getting it done is hard
you are such a procrastinator
you mean your abstract or other stuffs
my deepest condolences to you
where did you get that
so i have to say stuffs like i did this
i think it just means to talk in detail about what we did that is no problem for my current version of abstract because what other people did for me is just one sentence
well that one sentence encompasses a lot of different processes that surely takes up a lot ofwork what is your project about again
ya unfortunately no but i am sure you can make it sound exciting
otherwise you wouldnt be doing it
there are a lot of people in medicine in our summer program you will have your crowd
lots of stuffs to talk about it is primarily analysis of wet lab outputs but there are lots of analysis to be done
hey dont feel frustrated you arent responsible for choosing your own project sorry i meant you didnt choose your own project
ya thats all that matters what can we do with research
ya actually i am wondering whether they fixed that funding fiasco from cihr they had some real troubles with that a few years back
i see i havent heard much flaming from people recently so i am guessing the problem is being fixed
lol these past few days i have been encouraged and motivated to go back to science but i am smart enough to not do that the environment is good here at sickkids
but that masks the real financial issue scientists are experiencing
well it is the digital revolution
yeah hopefully this revolution will last my life time
ya i suppose it is but the real important thing is the ability to learn new stuffs quickly
you didnt have the right teacher you can just grab a good beginner book like maybe for python
sorry my pi called me out i recommend this book written for java by john carter
regardless i feel that it is good for you that you got into medicine if i didnt start software engineering i definitely would have applied to medicine right about now it is a trade off between excitement and stability
i think sacrifice will be made as long as you want to be intense about your career it is just that medicine has a higher level of baseline sacrifice if you will compared to other fields
that being said if i get into medicine i am pretty sure i would be successful there too lol dealing with stanley in the same career would also be fun in its own way
thats awesome dear friends working in the same career field is very fun
lol that guy doesnt need nobody
i dont know if you have noticed but he is not somebody who gets consumed at things because he doesnt get himself involved in things enough to be consumed
just not intensely but he will eventually get there
yeh
lol i dont care about anybody but myself i wouldnt have minded if stanley came to software nor me going to medicine
the last sentenec
lol maybe he has influenced me
ya i bet they do
i have been for better or for worse influenced by stanley my whole life i go back near the end of august when do you go back to windsor
well aint that nice you deserve a summer vacation
i heard you will have less and less vacation as you move further along in your medical career which sucks do you speak chinois at home
of course thats what i meant do you go back to china often
oh wow that is quite a lot
your entire family as in outside your immediate family right if you have made close connections with people back home then it is not that strange to go back so often
wait so you are an international student or you were an international a few years ago do you have any relatives in canada
well i am sorry to hear that your mother passed away that adds a new tragic perspective to your medical career i gotta reevaluate you completely now lol
well a normal medical student
which part of china did you come from by the way
oh thats nice nowadays when people talk about china they talk about shanghai rather than beijing
was beijing ever the toronto of china i am asking because i came from beijing out of sense of curiosity no pride
i see so shanghai is more modern in their architecture and technology i remember when i was in beijing 15 years ago there were still very primitive looking architectural designs and businesses all over the city not all over
haha that is true how can i forget that
i bet it feels very modern nowadays probably totally different from what i remembered i should probably go back there sometime
lol that sounds comical that it is making a comeback
well ya sure that is important
but they are not going to modernize historical stuffs to appeal to the new generation right something similar to that happens in japan where they try use anime characters to appeal to young people like everything for everything
ok good
what is there to learn about chinese culture
are you saying you are actively keeping up with literature and history of canada that you dont ahve time to learn chinese culture
well i am not exactly a culture type of person so i cant relate to your enthusiasm but good for you learning those things
yo speaking about photography i heard from julian today you were in his photography club
right
i took a photo of a kitchen recently cuz it looked really cool i want to show you
yes my cover photo i wish i could have a kitchen like that in the future and a house to complement that kitchen sorry i digressed
yo you do realize that photo of the kitchen is completely computer generated right
i mentioned it because i showed it to julian and he couldnt tell that it wasnt real
well he knew from the beginning that it wasnt real because i told him but he said if i hadnt told him he would think it was real
well now you know i wanted to mention this because i was talking to julian about the importance of lighting and composition camera angle too
what would you do to that kitchen picture to make it look prettier i am asking as an amateur at lighting
ok sure so my abstract just got finished editing and i can send it
how far along are you for your abstract
lol that was fast
i see thats why you werent that stressed about it but do you need to send it for review by your supervisor
right
it is unfortunate that you did not achieve your desired expectation in that front but at least you got valuable experience
take it easy nobody is at fault you just came out of first year med so nobody expects you to make huge impact right off the bat
i meant everybodys gotta start somewhere
he wont be back till late august
ok then he might be going somewhere afterwards cuz he mentioned that he cant make it to the poster session he wanted to use that opportunity to troll me at my presentation
i think he only does that to people he is familiar with actually that is a given
yo did you ever see anywhere on event brite that says what format the abstract has to be in is it just one huge paragraph without any sub headings like background method and result
ok thanks
basically i am having trouble writing a certain line how is yours going
ya same i didnt wanna bother my bosses so i didnt give them today but i gotta make sure to give it to them tomorrow the lab has been busy writing grants
ya not a fun period really i dont know why people cant just do this stuff ahead of time always leave things to the end
funding
well to be honest i find that people who leave stuff near deadline to leave everything they do near the end so it doesnt hardly matters whether you leave abstract or funding near the deadline get what i mean
i am not trying to judge just an observation
is that yours too
lol just curious
ya me too
deadline add more pressure than pump me up
but it sure does pump me up when it does lol
who convinced you to do that
well that is retarded
well cant trust senior people blindly gotta be realistic
what does that have to do with applying 3 days before deadline
oh i see
haha he had that nice sales pitch
but they are not gonna cut you out right
i mean you already got in and all
well too bad for those who are getting in late
selfincorporating what is that
i see lol so if they eliminate that how else can you become an earning doctor
i see i guess med students got stuffs to complain about too my parents keep telling me how stable and high earning medicine is but they obviously didnt do their research
right i dont know how to feel about that field now
to be fair i actually dont consider those sacrifices you mentioned to be that big of a deal
but i also need to maintain an objective mindset about my career path and fighting against that temptation is difficult
going back to life science i made a promise to myself before that i will stick to software engineering and never look back but i am looking back now lol
i have a firm grasp of how science works and how to think like a scientist and discovering new stuffs is fun but i also love making video games sorry not necessarily impact but just enough experience in general
you can be intense
work extra hard i mean be good at both
or you think realistically that is not possible
what makes you think taht
you know what i dont believe that one bit lol i think it depends on how you define success i wouldnt worry about success at that point
sorry i actually just came to the realization that i dont know what things you want to be good at lol you mentioned discovering and science you enjoy but those are the same thing
right so i actually dont see why you cant be a master at both things  and objectively speaking being good at multiple things is actually better than being good at only one societal impact if you will
because that is where all the mixing of the fields and innovations come from
i think you are in a great position
if you have the internal desire to get good at that kind of stuff then putting more into it wont seem hard
oh hell ya
that was like my past 23 years lol
i dont know i am thinking about making a game to improve students interest in science and i am also thinking about making a game with the theme of science thats about all the intersection i can think of
i think there are people who are better qualified to do those things i am way more interested in the intersection of art and technology art in the context of humanity and society
lol there is nothing to have full attention about i dont want to sound conceited here but i want to accelerate peoples learning speed make an entire population of people smarter thanks for your attention by the way lol
ya in fact that is exactly right
lol maybe i can help you with that in the future i am focusing on using photorealistic environments in combination with my interest in game design to create walking simulators it makes the learning that much more engaging
the intuitive answer to that is anything that requires physical touch but that can also be replaced in time i think it isnt really a matter of what shouldnt be replaced
but like would you let ai take over if one day an ai that is objectively better than doctors is developed
right you can train those stuffs though with virtual simulation
i think i am helping some people in ottawa develope a virtual speech practicing app during winter so that is something very similar to training doctors
for now you do ð
wait until i simulate emotions in ai lol
you sure about that i am playing this game called soma right now that game questions that statement you just made
exactly the way you just described if you implant emotion into a robot will you feel emotion for that robot so far the answer is yes i experienced first hand that you do experience emotion for an ai
her
never seen it
but it has good review i might check it out if i get bored but this reciprocation how is that different from what i discussed and what is its relevance for medicince i will brb
well to have this sort of argument we need to lay down some foundations lol like is the personal assistant someone who talks like a robot or was that personal assistant sounded like a human being
you know what i was about to disagree with you but i just ran a simulation in my head and i think you are right
but the thing about soma is that they are not just implanting ai with emotion they are actually implanting scans of peoples brain such that the robots basically harbor something close to their soul
but you see i was also joking when i said i would program ai with emotion so we can call it here
ya i get you but damn you had to try that game soma to fully appreciate what i meant that is the thing about video games
that extra dimension of interaction makes you think that robots are your friends you dont have to actually play it lol i just wanted to exaggerate the interactiveness of video games
but damn that was a cool conversation i think i am gonna sign off here to take care of some stuffs
ya thanks you too
i think this is great stuff they are doing sorry maybe not necessarily more difficult but heavily under appreciates underappreciated
ya that is exactly right i spent an entire year studying the business model of a company called labster that specialize in making life science laboratory simulations and they pretty much force feed the users with information rather than letting the users learn stuffs on their own
yo i am gonna talk to you later on monday i am over at my friends house right now but to be continued
yo whats up did you submit your abstract
yes
pi would be mad at me if i didnt
did you manage to get urs edited
any chance you are gonna work on your learning module stuff after summer
graphic design in what way
so what relevance does this have with medicine
so graphic user interface kind of stuff
right those boring ones the ones that we did on the first day
retained better in our head
lol that is quite the challenge
i think those are good points but i would be more worried about peoples perception going into your module
oh wait i guess it depends because if you are making some sort of module like the safety training quizzes then people wouldnt care about the content because people will take it seriously right from the start
i think you are not the only one i think that is in fact the best way to learn but a lot of people probably arent aware of that
right cant learn from listening it might be useful after you have done some tracheostomy but yes it wont make sense for someone completely new
ya was about to say that vr is going to accelerate learning of surgery i feel
isnt there already someone who is doing that in toronto ok
wait expensive as in they are not hospital funded projects
whats the expensive thing you are talking about the making of vr experience
the development cost
ya
brb
well thats no problem please enjoy your time i am surprised though that you are doing rock climbing at this hour
ya god knows we all need that
you rip off ur skin everyday at rock climbing i mean
i see i wish i had a rock climbing facility near me seems like fun
north york there isnt anything in north york
is that a rock climbing facility
lol i guess i need to open my eyes
jesus i wish i knew that before i started working when i get back home nowadays i just hit the sack after dinner
sorry not literally i go to sleep at 11 but i dont want to do something intense as rock climbing when i am tired anyways i gotta enter subway i will chat with you later
yo are you at the sumer student seminar
concussions effect on brain
not very already bored lol mostly cuz i am not in this field maybe you might be interested since you are a clinican
yea north york why
maybe next time stanley is back in town we can have coffee or something after work
cant watch it now but i have read about that somewhere from one of the books i read
it was making the comparison between seeking for immediate results vs mastery the power of believing you can improve is basically a fancy way of saying that if you keep practicing a craft long enough you will eventually reach a point where you have enough knowledge and skill set to perform a task that you couldnt perform before hence the improvement
according to dweck people can hold two different views of their own intelligence those who have an entity theory believes that intelligence exists within usin a finite supply that we cannot increase those who subscribe to an incremental theory believe that while intelligence may vary slightly from person to person it is ultimately something that with effort we can increaseif you believe intelligence is a fixed quantity then every educational and professional encounter becomes a measure of how much you have if you believe intelligence is something you can increase then the same encounters become opportunities for growth in one view intelligence is something you demonstrate in the other its something you develop
i am pretty sure you are entity
lol i was joking
you are saying that it is not black and white
of course i think upraising itself is important and it is debatable if that is entity or incremental because on one hand it is physically an incremental process since you are being taught by the people who raise you
right i shouldnt actually be asking that type of question because i need to focus on myself lol
well he just has that mindset he is not saying that our theory is wrong he was saying that he cant apply the thinking of incremental theory because of his inflexible mindset
yes all the time i spent with that kid i know he is an entity guy
i dont think he has a goal
but he doesnt believe he can reach people who are at a higher plane than he is at
too hard because he thinks other people are much smarter compared to him lol you know what i dont think stanley would appreciate me telling you about this he is a secretive guy
thats cool
ya certainly i think it is also important to have a clear idea of how doing certain things will improve your performance i think those smart people we are talking about might be extremely good at this
haha that is awesome i think i only recently started learning like that because last year i finally started learning about things that i am genuinely passionate about and i got the opportunity to learn with curiosity i think i would have been much more successful if i had done that during my previous undergrad
hey you know what now that i think about it i know one person who doesnt have much interest in learning but she still got high grades so maybe there is innate intelligence intelligence in writing tests i mean
ya that is true that is why i didnt wanna talk about it anymore because there is too much i dont know lol
didt want to make any sort of judgement
ya good for you
ya for sure i am pretty happy about where i am now by the way your last line sounds like my father at the end of every conversation he literally says hao hao gan as in do good work
lol he is bitter
anyways whats are you up to these days i am gonna go downtown to play mahjong with stanley today
ya
hanging out with your friends
lol what why do you have to go back to windsor for that
i see well i hope you are productive or were
i see
crazy about what
you havent told me anything that makes me think you are crazy lol
well i work on weekends so that is not crazy that photo of the kitchen i sent you was made during my weekend times and sometimes during weekdays after an exhausting day at work
my father taught me that i am sure you probably learnt from your father too i think taht is a good trait if you got nothing better to do might as well be productive
ya i do my best as well to plan activities i do need to keep in touch with the world once in a while i am gonna sign off now it was nice a nice conversation
thanks i will
lol good for you you sure love that stuff
i see i am done listening to or reading more books on self improvement because i feel that most of them are some variation on the content of the book that i was talking to you about anyways
thats what happens when you spend a lot of time thinking about stuffs anyways i am gonna sign off hope you had a productive day
yup good night
i wasnt given any specific instruction but i would go to kinkos right next to sickkids
i printed my mt sinai poster there some 4 years ago
at utposter or kinkos i think somebodys gotta pay for it too probably our supervisor if that is the case it could be a pain because we gotta ask them for the lab credit card
lol that is too bad
they are forcing you to do a poster as part of the job but they dont cover it for you ironic
oh is that right
well you definitely should i am sure your poster will be awesome
alright cant believe this is the last week i cant wait to just get out of here and do some fun stuffs
my work is basically dead now
what kind of stuffs
stuffs you will be able to finish by friday
lol ok my supervisor hasnt been around to talk to me about exciting stuffs and she is busy writing grant so nothing exciting to do here for me when are you leaving for china again
damn whatever happened to that coffee with stanley
well lemme talk to the man and see if he is interested
ya he isnt well if not we will always be in touch here on fb hey it is either today or after aug 21
are you like doing anything right now
he is around downtown
ok
ya 5 is cool no problem i will ask stanley you got any suggestions on where to meet
60 tahoma where is jimmys
is that like a coffee shop
stanley asks if you want bubble tea instead cuz he isnt interested in coffee at the moment
that is the one on dundas right
ok
ya so it is bubble republic at 5pm it is ok if you are not there exactly on time no pressure
ye
30mb i have high resolution images
well as long as it looks full the size of the file shouldnt be an indication of content
photo resolution will look very low on the poster if it wasnt high in the original image
sur yo lets save each other from boredom because i am dying from it now
no sweat
ya not really trying to fight it off chatting with other people
lol you can talk about anything
well yes you did
i am just remarking lol we can talk about that another time too if you want i went through an actual depression once and i learnt a lot from it
i think everybody goes through depression at some point in their life aint no way around it
yo no worries would you have preferred less time
right that is a good way to look at it
i was randomly thinking about it on the bus ride back home and i realized that the topic is something that interests me quite a bit
because it has to do with management in the sense that you are trying to get the school to adopt a certain way of doing things
ya for sure there is no doubt that you should aim for excellency in your craft at all times it is unfortunate that not everybody thinks like that maybe galvanize them after having a good discussion
but of course that is all your choice and that takes a lot of energy
good for you then
haha ya but since you were serious about i thought i should share some thought with you about it
haha ya i got that pun a few times in my life
it is hard with the way our society is run to have that level of transparency i think people are easy to judge i still am even though i am trying to be more open about foreign things
but it also has something to do with your natural disposition for openness and i was going to say that i think you are an easy person to talk to
you can think however you wish about that lol i am just saying what comes to my mind
ya for sure do you still remember that discussion we had about ai showing love and empathy
i was arguing that ai can replace human interaction and you were arguing against that because ai as we know do not have emotion even if they show it since everything is programmed ring a bell
i had a revelation again today lol you see this weekend i finished the game soma i was telling you about and it raised a very interesting point
i am assuming that the reason why he left is because he knows that the simulation is not real and he wanted the real thing can easily
right that is very true and we dont do drugs because we know that is for pussies ð anyways i heard what i want from you this conversation is over as far as i am concerned
i wanted to challenge your original claim about the ai and it turned out that you were an idealistic person who seeks meaning in doing things in the real world
well i did come up with these ideas and i wanted to treat these ideas with respect by discussing about them with the person who will be most interested in them but there were things i was looking for
save that for tomorrow when i am actually bored in the office i am hitting the sack for the night
ya good night
i have but i am not gonna prepare for it takes too long to get fluent with it waste of time
i think you should just go in there and talk forget about the prizes thats what the script is for
i thought i wanted the prizes but i realized last night i have no need for the prize i am pretty sure you can present it without a script
you mean you think you need a script to do well
if you practice for a bit then you will be good you can write down the general flow of the presentation that will probably help
well good luck on dat i am done with my poster gonna print it today
oh damn yo how does utposter work my lab uses that
in what format
ok yo whats the material you used for the poster hq glossy
ok pick up at store
lol good job yo how did you pay for the utposter
can you only pay at the pick up place or is there a place online that lets you pay by credit cuz i havent seen a credit payment system online for utposter
ok thanks for the info i found the description of how it works just now they let you pay with only credit card number and expiration date
ya i am too we can talk about boredom lol that is a weird topic
like what kind of things
what is transition report
oh right that is what i am writing too except it is more focused on scientific observations than transitioning
it has some transition elements but those are not the focus
it is incredibly boring to write a pure transition report though
lol
i would argue the former sorry i meant it can be a mix of both nobody enjoys doing tedious tasks
read other things like papers related to your research
oh ok then what do you do if you are not reading you mentioned you are interested in chinese culture and all dat
i am just giving an example
so when you say borderline depressed you mean just lying on bed and not wanting to do anything or something similar
well that sounds pretty normal to me i occasionally have that but havent had one recently but when i do have those episodes i think i try to find entertainment on youtube
gotta get yourself to that activation energy level
ive been keeping myself busy recently with work but after this whole thing is over i am gonna switch over to books and planning for my next game dev project there will be plenty of stuffs to do
book i am currently reading the jews story of a people for the game dev project i am gonna make a singleroom narrative driven puzzle game about a poltergeistlike being trolling the player
have you read his works
that was published in 1860 dont you feel the language and prose has changed a lot
well thanks for the source are you just generally interested in all kinds of classical work or did you want to get something out of reading his work
yes
i think it is good especially since you are so young
but is it important to stay focused
you think it was important for you to internalize those information
the way i see it is that it is great to read about a lot of things just to have it at the back of your head it feels like memorizing things like in undergrad
i see well you can read it multiple times then lol read it until you get it
i think you can consciously put more effort into internalizing it but it will take a long time before you see any drastic improvement in your ability to internalize things you read i personally dont worry about it though
it is a skill for highly productive people or people who deal with paper works
when i say productive i dont mean in the sense of actually getting things done
i dont actually think it is necessary for productive people now i know active reading is a skill necessary for physicians cuz they look at patient history all the time in that sense it is important
see that is actually what i use information around me for creative problem solving but i dont think you need active reading skill for that
do you find yourself internalizing information much easier when you actually have a problem you want to solve
you can go ahead and do that anything that works for you lol
my impression of writing stuffs down is that you are going back to memorizing stuffs like you are in undergrad and information kept in your head will always deteriorate
lol whats the difference
ok but idea can also deteriorate at least the intricate details of the ideas will
lol ok i get what you are saying i forgot that philosophers and ethicists live and breath ideas
they are not like engineers which is the mindset taht i have adopted
i think we all apply some level of theoretical understanding to problem solving regardless of your specialty but more specifically for me i need to gain understanding from learning from practical experience
ya for those fields it is good to have reading skill holy shit that was an intense topic
well i havent chatted about intellectual stuffs with anybody in a long time and you are a tougher cookie than stanley lol
haha ya i feel you i like discussing those latter stuffs than the former but most people are the opposite
what percentage of your conversations are mindless if you put a number to it
whao are the indepth conversations from people in sickkids
welp it has been a pleasure for me to discuss these kinds of things but after a little while i think i will get tired of this type of conversation i should do it in moderation
i am sure you are still full of energy for another indepth topic lol
it is only 2pm
you are welcome i staved off boredom for an hour or so so thats good
think about my report and write it are you still unmotivated
have fun with that i am gonna sign off for now and contemplate i will probably chat with you tomorrow
afternoon but i am going to check every poster today
915
thats when it starts
ya for sure i guess i will see you later i am practicing my speech without a script though
yes
i am goinng to audi gonna find julian and comp
i am at the back for now left for china yet
cool was just gonna say it was fun interacting with you this summer so lets keep correspondence
you probably wont get this message since you are in china but i read today that bioware a huge video game development company was founded by three medical students right after they graduated med school and now they all work in fields that has nothing to do with medicine
they initially tried their hands on game development since they played games and they could do a bit of coding
they were supposedly moderately successful right off the bat and the temptation to have a career in the field was too much they were all med students they were probably smart enough to learn coding on their own
how was your trip to china
lol it is 10am over here stuck in alaska as in something happened with your flight and yes i believe you should learn at least up to the first year university level programming
you can spend some sightseeing the place then some time
aint nothing you can do about a plane problem
thats unfortunate
haha sure would be nice i actually want to go there wondering in the snow field one day
i have seen it all the time in pictures and they all look beautiful
oh hell ya i will do that once i am richer than i am now
lol
you mean like everybody in the city is rich or vast majority of them or you mean the city has huge amount of resources
are they like feudal lord level rich
but we also got a bunch of people like that here in north america come to think of it like those people from sharks tank and dragons den
i see
yo by the way i tried reading those john stuart mill books they were actually a lot harder to read than i had originally expected
it is not about the content it is just the structure of the old english
utilitarianism
the sentence structure is like using so much inbetween thoughts such as this in sentences such that you will have to read them many times undoubtly in order to understand the sentence do you get what i mean
i will tackle it probably some other time maybe winter instead of those books i read the history of discovery of insulin which was actually very fascinating maybe you have read it too since you are so well read
not sure if you took bch242
but one of the professors in the course who taught metabolism told us all kinds of story about the discovery of insulin and i felt like i was imbued with some misconceptions lol
oh i see but you always told me you were from mogen or at least i got the impression of
and you took a bunch of fourth year mogen courses and that course taught by brent derry
ok anyways there was also that jrr macleod building right next to medsci and i never knew the significance of that person until i read about history of insulin
banting
lol not really
insulin is not technically a uoft discovery
because the major contributors towards the discovery came from somebody from western and alberta i wouldnt say that uoft had any big part in the discovery i associate the discovery more with the individuals than with the organization
haha yes always nice to have advertisements and banting himself was not a very talented researcher or physician the more you read about this the less admirable the people involved in it becomes lol
true dat you know that actually brings up the topic of biomedical research funding in canada actually nah it is not very important here
well then maybe i will fire away lol i wanted to say that reserach in canada are funded by having intentional research topics
yes that is understandable
lol so what is a good doctor
based on your answer i feel that anything you need to be a good doctor is needed for being good at anything else
i will brb in an info session now
yo go on you were saying that the presentation was weird
i am curious about your internal conflicts
you probably had better resume than stanleys lol
well that really depends on what field you are on i think medicine is one of those fields that require image building so i dont view resume with the same importance as people such as yourself
well aint nothing you can do about it
yup character development is something that i will be doing for the rest of my life and i think all of us once we get the opportunity to develop our character will find that an enjoyable exercise
thanks later thanks for the chat too yo you mentioned you have a friend who is in the game industry right
i dont have any friends who are in the agme dev industry so there is no reference for me for how i should advance my career in this field
thanks a lot i owe you one
well i appreciate your effort how are things at windzor
too fast for you
i get what you are saying
too much
why dont you talk to people who are more advanced in their medical career
they might give you some reassurance
do they offer career development type of activities in your program
that is tough in this case friends two or three years ahead would help a lot more right
you might find some of them if there are medical student clubs
i think just talking to people itself can slightly help with that wait actually i am curious what you mean you dont know what you want
well i thought you wanted to do genetics
hmm to me all medical fields from a technical perspective are all the same because it is easy to learn technical knowledge and any technical field can become enjoyable the more you master it
haha yayou spend a lot of time being involved in the field you love but there is no guarantee that you are the best in that field
so like whats stopping you from getting involved in those things you mentioned like conferences publications and awards or sorry you were saying you dont know which to do
yeaaaa i am having the same problem i am developing my own game because i want to show employers that i can do game dev but this project will take a really long time to finish
lol ya damn shame
i actually have the exact same problem you are having lol i have been contemplating whether i want to participate in extracurriculars like hackathons or just focus on my own game design project
at least they can be helpful the first few times this conversation made me realize that i actually should participate in more of those events unfortunately i dont know what the equivalent is for medicine
but those are slow too
yeah i am look some ip up my university might organize one
it is a good prize to pay for career advancement i think you know all about deprivation dont you tina
yes he knows all about sleep deprivation but sometimes you need to deprive yourself to accomplish things at least in the tech workd world
nope lsd is like one of those drugs used by any kind of creatives even in tech industru like steve jobs which company is using it now
looking forward to it i just read the article
i thhink so there are probably a few that talks about this specific topic but the one i read gave me some nice background i feel in general any kind of drug abuse should be frowned upon
which makes them seem like very desperate people
that is a good point i forgot about that you know now that i think about it i dont see the same thing in the field of medicine so maybe it is an issue with pressure
it is an unfortunate problem yo how is life going with you these days
not very busy and lacks motivation to work for some reason i was just thinking today maybe i should have stayed in biology lol
nothing really maybe because the stuffs i am doing now is not very interesting
studying for exams feels like a waste of time going to class feels like a waste of time
like sometimes i just feel that there is a more efficient way to learn things than going to classes and cramming for exams
no problem
later
yo whats up
didnt know you play volleyball
when did you start playing
rec team
right but i would imagine it is still pretty intense
lol no
so you are the setter for the team setter and server
right
i know some volleyball from watching this incredibly popular anime about volleyball it is called haikyuu have you ever heard about it
thats fair in the anime they really hype up every single moves the players make in the volleyball game that it makes you want to play the sport for real
but obviously reality is totally different from fiction it takes such a long time to master even the basics
yo what do you think about an online md degree
nope i think there are some obvious reasons for why an online md degree doesnt exist oh wait it does exist actually university of phoenix is doing it
what is vc system
so you think in person teaching is absolutely necessary
i was contemplating about a business that offers a md degree that minimizes classroom attendance
yes i know
well theoretically speaking an md degree done right would would certainly require physical interactions but it is just the classroom learning that needs to be replaced that is my understanding anyways
well that is certainly ideally what happens but in practice classroom learnings are often reduced to just doing well on tests is it not maybe you can tell me how your classroom is
i see
you actually know people who study purely for the knowledge
like these people dont care about how well they do on tests but they will be diligent about absorbing as much information as possible for the sake of mastering medicine
lol i think i am talking to an exception here
do you know anybody else who has that strategy
ya i get you
so it is important to set up a system where there is no pressure to get high grade on tests if the passfail wasnt there you wouldnt be using your current strategy
yes most definitely exams are cancerous
well i think they are but in reality there isnt any consequence for me to get b or c grades wont have much of an impact on my career anymore
but i still need to get out of that mindset though that i need to get as in everything mindset
it doesnt help that everybody around me are getting as lol
well there are people in the facebook chat just saying what they got on tests and in the interview room there was one kid just literally talking about his gpa and his classmates gpa
because of the pressure to get grades i have been procrastinating like hell for the past several weeks
ive been playing video games watching youtube videos and generally being unproductive
it doesnt work like that for me i am the most motivated when my mind is clear additional pressure clouds my judgment
that is a good strategy that i often use except my mind wonders off a lot in class too lol
its cool i just had dinner and playing dota
ya but now i am back to work
sounds like some deep stuffs going on between you two thanks for talking to him about this his opinions are very helpful
right for now i am gonna sleep though cuz i got an exam tomorrow
ya i know
lol how visiting friends
that is pretty sick which conference some kind of cell biology stuff
cool stuff lots of general health related topics are you doing any presentations i imagine you wouldnt go to far away health conference just to listen to other people
i see well i am sure you will learn quite a lot you can also network too i might be able to visit you on sunday
howâs the conference
no problem wasnt intending to anyways
where are you staying though
not in marriott hotel
oh that is pretty far this week was reading week and i have been just playing games and watching youtube videos and doing my assignments and i just came back home from a cs exam
ya sure
haha ya i am really happy for myself
there are some great topics there too like game deveopment
not just the usual high level computer science stuff so i am really looking forward to this
no but i am learning things on my own
i am learning about the lightning system in the game development software i am using lighting this is where skills in photography would come into play
lol maybe if i have the right equipmenys
oh ya have you ever taken any photography courses
maybe i should do that too haha i see myself doing it once i want to have full mastery of the subject
but right now i am still learning the user interface of lighting softwares i bet there are
when i say lighting software i relaly mean any game development software that have lighting controls and software like blender that lets you make scenes
lighting software is really different from photography because the lightings are simulated rather than natural oh ya i am way past that stage now coding is straight forward what is hard for me is making a beautifully looking game
haha ya right now i cant tell between a bad looking scene from a good looking scene because i have no knowledge of lighting or photography anyways how was your conference
what was interesting about it
i see doesnât canada already have universal health care though
haha right how can i forget that lots of logistics involved in good health care
not very surprised to hear that i mean that is what biomedical science does everyday lol deep research value
so you enjoyed your stay in ottawa
oh hell naaaw people who are in ottawa tends to get sick or were you sick before you came here
ya that really sucks and had to happen right during the conference
thatâs the attitude ainât nothing canât be done but still truly a shame though i remember when i was sick this past month i just wanted to go home and lie on bed couldnât do anything productive
aint that nice
what is your friend doing in ottawa or an ottawa native
ooh i see yo how is life
well i am not busy just came back from hackathon
oh ya maybe i should show you what we did it is really silly
httpsdevpostcomsoftwarepocketpup i learned a lot from the event i actually thought maybe you might be interested in hearing some of the stuffs that i say
and then there were also some products made in the hackathons that can help peoples lives i thought to myself hmm so there are products like that
i am not sure how you felt but i always thought that a huge portion of technology doesnt actually help peoples lives but monetize them by encouraging addictive behaviors
like i think facebook is a pretty good example
most certainly
go on
regarding 1 like i thought about it after seeing that movie i talked about there is really no way around it but we need to make sure that there is a tangible bbenefit from using online health repositories
well this is all i had in my mind now but i will type out the other things i thought about that are interesting you should sleep if you are tired
actually the first thing you said about using whatever means to motivate students to learn is a very good point if students start depending on how fun a learning game is it could be an indication of deficiency in other teaching methods rather than an unhealthy need for gamification
ya lol
there was someone who really looked like you
no it was for a brief second and it was kind of far away so i didnât get a chance to have a closer look
decent i am looking forward to the break and excited to get out of this semester which has not been very productive for me are you studying for exams
then when do you have them
i see so you have like year long classes
the block ends in next jan
well that is fortunate you will be refreshed and hopefully more motivated after the break
haha
well you gotta find out whatâs draining you but i came to the personal realization that when we are not motivated we are just lazy
that reluctance to work right
burnout is a complicated issue did you think you worked too hard this semester
like studying and working endlessly and during those times you werent pushing yourself to keep going
sorry you were
well seems like you know your limit now
would you have to work over the winter break though
i heard from stanley that you guys have work
you can find your own time for that
yo hows it going you finished your exams
haha well i am honoured sure but i think i will probably talk to you tomorrow since i will be sleeping very soon gonna go to work early tomorrow but enjoy your night
i am doing pretty well now started work for two weeks so far and i have been able to take things slowly at my own pace its an ideal place to intern at i would say
i work at a telecommunication company learning the rope of the industry lol for now they are just making me do pretty routine stuffs but hopefully by the end of the term i can do something more amazing
wow spending vacation time in a different country sounds awesome my parents fed me pretty hard over the break do your parents go anywhere else or are they living in australia now
damn melbourne that sounds nice anyways umgame development is just a general term for spending effort to make a game depending on peopleâs reaction i will take it all the way to publication hopefully that happens
it is a first person puzzle game you basically control a character and you see everything he sees you need to figure out ways to put them back to where they belong
i thought chhinois is getting better
i have a coworker from beijing saying they are turning down all the pollution and stuff is it the economic condition
i see well at least your parents can live in a more beautiful country good for them by the way was it warm over at melbourne new year was pretty cold in ontario
lol definitely canât complain about that
until end of april i wouldnât stay here any longer than that because i want to move around and be exposed to different envionments it is really different from medicine
ahh i see i didnât think about that and right i was asking about your speciality what are you thinking about now
what made you rule out surgery in my mind that is probably the most thrilling specialty cutting people up and all saving peopleâs life with mad precision of your scalpel
firstly thoigh i wanted to say that it is pretty normal to feel paranoid about your career decisions if you do i mean you might be better suited for research than clinical work based on our conversations
you must have been very sleepy when we were chatting too tired from exams or maybe the alcohol did the trick
sounds tough for you ya sure chat another time you enjoy yours too ð
hey its cool i was working on a cover letter stanley helped me edit it he made it like a million times better lol what a guy
ya you guys should
well i donât know i am just doing a lot of things lately during my spare time i am reading a book about machine learning and it actually made some pretty cool arguments about how it can solve everything
the master algorithm like think about this it is possible to create an ai that can predict everything and anything the way to do it is by reverse engineering evolution or our brain
can you tell me why you think that
right so i havenât explained enough there are other tools that you can incorporate in an ai to improve that like statistics logic and network mapping i just started a few days ago still only on trhe first 20
lol maleable you mean
maleable is apparently incorrect on facebook it shows up as red
oh right how are you doing
reflections reflecting on your life and stuff
damn that is diligent do you find yourself accomplishing many of them
can you give me an example of what you have achieved last year
taht is quite a lot of books
well you got me
that is a funny one i dont usually think about it in terms of goals for me if it happens then it happens and i also make more short term goals rather than long term ones
to be honest you are doing way more stuffs than me so making any comments about you not doing enough would be hypocritical of me
is the snowboarding like something you jsut wanted to do
what is carms
well he isnt a very ambitious person so that reaction is understandable but that doesnt mean you shouldnt do it it is good to aim high
yes absolutely make sure you got enough of that intrinsic motivation to do what you are doing
by the way what are the books that you read last year i am very curious i am looking for good books to read to replace the time i used to spend playing games lol
is that like an app
well i dont have it
but it should be easy to download it
wait is that the site you referred to me when you showed me where i can find those books by john stuart mill
lord of the flies that brings back memories
i read it in grade 10 for english class at that time i had no appreciation for any sort of political or social metaphor whatsoever so it didnt intrigue me much
ya the monthly goal can certainly help with that you should read principle of education that is a short read but also very informative
nah it is not it is an essay written like some 50 years ago but still very relevant and i vaguely remember that you were interested in the topic of education right
i recently bought da vinci the biography written by walter issacson he also wrote the biography of steve jobs like 5 years ago both of whom are my absolute heroes lol
ya he published the book like in 2017 october the moment that i saw it was on sale on amazon i secretly bought the book on my ipad in class and skipped it to read it lol
tell me about it
haha ya they are inspirational for sure
nope what is it
well first of all i totally agree with that because a book that i absolutely adore also mentioned the same thing
in what way are you lacking it like you are not practicing medicine enough
i mean do you think it is because you are in med school and it is busy like you have limited time and stuff
i have a few things to say about it i am also very distracted and quite honestly i think i have one of the shortest attention spans amongst my friends
ya like i said it is a balance you need those spur of the moment ideas but you need to combine it with some level of diligence
setting high goals for yourself lol can you give me an example what your discouragement
yo you gotta start somewhere you dont need to solve the entire thing in one go you can think of areas that seem to be the easiest and just start from there brb i am gonna warm my dinner
like if school is not too bbusy for you now you can start working on your ideas right now getting things started is the rate limiting step for a lot of creatives unfortunately
well i hope this goes well for you let me know how it goes in the mean time i am gonna focus on finishing this ai book and also my game dev project
yup i can see how i am going to finish at least the demo so that keeps me motivated to work on it a lot
haha thanks anyways i think i am gonna sign off for now to have dinner and then get some work done it was really nice catching up with you today
looking forward to it later
i signed up
lol well it is probably me
i am in quebec
lol yes thats me
yup yo you read like hundreds of books on goodread i am looking at your profile and there are like 14 pages each with 10 books that you have read am i reading that right
well do you know anybody else who read that much
if i kept a log maybe i have read like 20 books over the last 10 years i dont know 136 seems like an overwhelming number to me lol
you got some incredible friends
and you are now in burlington or is taht really close to windzor
i see in time i will update this log i will see how unread i am lol
ya i know i am just joking around but i really should read more because my interests are too narrow
ya that is definitely an appeal you can learn to express those ideas when you talk with other people it can also fill you with confidence in your own worldview if the book shares some similar opinions as you
haha that is a good mentality i hope to write better too
well thats what makes us wake up early and drill hard into the night
i appreciate that comment ð and yes it is very romantic and thats what i like
gonna sign off now good night
lol what did you observe are you chatting with the right person
ya you told me half a year ago
so what did you see or hear
lol
doesnât that take like forever
i mean is there a necessity to study that hard when the exam grades are passfail
do you know what they want out of it
well that is a lot of reassurance to study for more than 4x than most people
i donât know if i should feel sorry for you guys or be admired
ya i concur with that but honestly though i have this impression that the intensity that you guys put in to studying is primarily useful for writing exams
thatâs the reason why i feel bad for you guys
hahaha well
ya you can go ahead and convince yourself but i guess that is necessary in medical for sanity i suppose
and motivation
you know thatâs the thing you survive at the end of the day but i think surviving isnât good enough like you gotta feel like you are moving forward towards your goal
well thatâs good yo i got this great business idea what do you think about a chatbot that researchers can use to ask really detailed scientific questions and the chatbot would have an answer for it
i absolutely agree with that but the point of the app is to point people to key information without needing spend hours scouring the net for the right articles think about the amount of time it would save
ya that is the other use i feel like i can build a business out of an app like this lol i am gonna try out this idea in a programming event in a week
thanks take care of urself in school donât be like those who spend 8 hours studying for one lecture
i didnât know you were someone who take care too much of yourself but ok
isnât that what we all should strive for we should all be like you being serious here i am not a proponent of studying intensively in a school environment
maybe you can do some of that during this summer if you donât have any plan yet
i heard from stanley that this is going to be your last âfreeâ summer
so maybe you should spend it like it is your last lol hopefully your plans fit that description
well of course you should do what you want in life
you will figure it out since you spend so much time taking care of yourself
by the way remember a few weekends ago i was working on my application to work in japan i got it i will be working in honda starting in september
the cover letter that i told you about that stanley helped edit was the cv for the job application it will be for 8 months
i am telling all of my friends about this cuz i am so happy lol
haha thanks
damn straight there isnât any other way you gonna get wrecked in clerkship lol but i am sure you are prepared mentally i will send you images of good time in japan in your darkest moments
haha that might turn around after me going to japan but its cool i enjoy making people jealous
i will try to remember that
i will be enjoying the onsen in japan when you have the 24 hour shift
it aint your fault i am the person who bonds over miseries
well it is easy to make dark humors during dark times nobody would feel offended when done in the right context and people stop taking themselves seriously
ya
right
as long as they are not ahead of you genetically then you can get anything you want if you put effort into it but that takes time
i dont know about your dad sounds like a bitter loser who focuses too much on other people and from the sounds of it it sounds serious how do you currently deal with this jealousy you speak of
dang girl thats some deep stuff i think you just need to be confident that one day you can also gain what you want a belief like that sort of makes you feel like you already possess those things
ya thats the thing you gotta try yo the other day i was reading this post on redditrelationship and dont ask me why i was reading it
well good to know that i wont be judged there was this girl who was supposedly a complete mess in the early part of her life
i mean i wouldnt necessarily believe in misery but certainly a trigger to make you realize or motivate you to be someone greater than who you are now
you think so huh i am on the other camp primarily because motivation created by misery wont last very long because misery is something that can come and go
yes that is true miserydespairfear all gives you that instant boost in focus and concentration so you can get your ass out of there
i donât know what your miseries are
haha
i can see it being framed as a misery though
if you donât do a residency in toronto then where will you go
late night to drive back home later
oh cool pushups and weights
long term as in
unfortunately that is the career limitation of being a doctor too competitive to be doing anything else
or maybe not necesaarily career limitation just life style limitation in general
i disagree man today i was reading about being a renaissance man i think anybody can do it you just need the will and spend time wisely
awww are you serious
you gotta stay tough
what is it
i mean why not do it
lol
does this have something to do with you knowing chinese
that sounds like a fairly straightforward idea
i concur
gotta put your pen on a paper first
sure thing julian can give you some useful advice
i mean you saw his post right
he came back to ottawa to pursue a career in writing
he made a post a while back i reached out immediately after i saw it
asked him if he got tired of research lol thats honestly like my first thought every time somebody moves out of research
in his case he was far from tired of it
yo i am looking for this silly ass writing i did half a year ago i wanna share just give me a sec
you sent an attachment you sent an attachment you sent an attachment crude language and graphical content reader discretion is advised but the order in which i sent them to you is how you should start reading them
there isnt any sort of moral to the story it was made purely for shock
yes
ya a possessed kyle
yes
no doug was always me
doug was too late
hahahaha this was made for pure black humor it wasnt meant to give people nightmare when i showed this story to stanley he laughed his ass off i guess thats the moral of the story
ya character development is key in my opinion plot is not as important as the character
oh ok well good luck with that just out of curiosity is a real story that you aim to create or a fictional one last question before bed
that sounds intense
ya of course if you dont glorify one it is just going to be another case study anyways good luck with that i am off to bed
night
i donât get the joke oooh i get it by the way did you do anything for valentines
not yet it is already over the white knight didnât show up for you so i heard from stanley that you guys had dumpling at your house on valentineâs how nice of you
ahh i see i am gonna be busy with a hackathon for the weekend so i will catch up with you another time
uottawa
by the way i think all the boys in your class appreciate you helping them sooth their loneliness
no i am the one who said that but i am assuming
you know what now that you question it i am not sure if thatâs how they felt
had a date with my game project
it went pretty well thanks for asking we made this program that can recognize fruits when you point the camera at it i managed to socialize with people and saved 2 days worth of food
you were back in toronto huh price to pay for med school isnât limited to the tuition
ya i know i meant medicine is so busy that costs you relaxation time
but sometimes you just gotta take some time off otherwise you lose motivation to work
jesus 12 days of work i donât remember when was the last time i worked that hard
ya i know what you meant ainât no way around it unfortunately for you guys
its raining over there
have fun with dat i gotta get back to work
lol
there was a quote from a book that said something similar
i mean from my stand point you certainly donât look figured out
i wouldnât call myself figured out but i have a good plan for the next several years so i might have it more figured than the people around me so your friend might be right in that sense
just let the good things come to you ya
never
well i will definitely give it a read at like 7 or 8pm
i definitely appreciate it and i think i will enjoy it too i want to know what you felt from reading that commencement
you get mad easily or something
lol you got to control your frustration
you got part 2
i think that is very important i would say it is a responsibility to see things objectively
i just got to say though this commencement wasnt anything particular eye opening for me primarily because i feel like i already adopted this kind of mindset but it was surprising to hear that you take its advice
i dont know i didnt feel much from it other than encouraging people to think in terms of other peoples shoes
maybe you can explain it to me
ok
yo that is a very important statement you are making there kind of reminded me about pulp fiction for a bit and yes reorientating yourself regularly is incredibly important
wtf damn shame
have you ever seen this movie called pulp fiction
ok and ya that is what it is famous for but a lot of people miss the message behind the violence and over indulgent reference to pop culture
analyzed from a philosophical perspective the movie is about how this one gangster doesnt realize the wrong he is doing while serving his gangster boss because he worships materialistic power and doesnt have a personal moral compass to guide his life
just all part of the process of searching for where we need to take our lives
oh ya i heard from stanley that you guys do lots of reflection essays or writings
of courae it is who doesnât like writing about their own opinions
example
that is interesting
dissociated huh
that is a very interesting question dont you do things because you know it is right you wouldnt do anything that you feel is wrong
well if you love to dwell on those kinds of things then yes
also has to do with habit i think it is more habit than anything
yo have you ever had any plan to become an expert at things outside of medicine
i donât really have a description but letâs use somebody who was trained in that profession as a benchmark being proficient enough as somebody who practices in that industry
what is health economics
i have been thinking recently about being proficient at many things in life because they all seem so much fun and interesting but then i have too many things i want to do
what limits you
so that is your approach huh
i donât think trying many things at a time works but i believe in spending large amount of time in many things over a long period of time sorry i wasnât trying to send that last message
much longer as in how long
i mean those are things that you can easily forget but something like programming you wonât forget easily so yes it depends i would still have 30 years or so to use those expert knowledge for my own interest
i see that is kind of similar with you
that is an unfortunate truth but i feel like you would have more innovative research if you are interdisciplinary so that is a plus
if you like doing things then surgery is definitely the path for you
but surgery is competitive and ironically awarded to the people who thought and studied a lot in med scholl
i mean isnât surgery a competitive position
so it would be given to people who have studied well in med school right like extremely well like your friend who studies 8 hours per lecture
lol ok
i see
well you wouldnât choose a career path simply for getting respect
wouldnât there be opportunities to move around in the type of surgeries you do
i am surprised that you didnt mention any about emergency surgeries anyways i aint the expert in this field so i can only imagine what you can do
the one unfortunate issue with medicine is that it takes too many years to train somebody partly because it is not something that people can readily practice actually i just had another great idwa
lol really
are there any footages of it online type out your thoughts i am gonna go jog
just came back from work will answer in a bit my question to you is what is wrong with greedily pursuing the things we want
can you give me like some examples
i see
was your father like absolutely hellbent on certain things for me i dont feel a need to stop myself unless the things taht i am doing is causing me physical or social harm andor psychological harm
then i guess you just gotta be appreciative of what you have easy but i guess if you grew up with that kind of relentless mindset then maybe it is difficult to appreciate things
can you give me like an actual example of something your father pursued in the past one would think that if you reach the goal you set for yourself then you would be happy
maybe deep inside he is very satisfied with himself but he is just always aiming high
have you thought maybe his unhappiness originated from else where
i guess that is just unfortunate that your father has that attitude but do you have a similar mentality
things dont happen quickly
i am trying to think in your shoes but it is hard for me i dont feel the impulse or the dissatisfactino you speak of
lol all about you
i can tell you from experience it takes years to get out of a setinstone mindset but recognizing the problem is the first important step to getting out of it i realized i might have experienced your problem bbefore
playing a team video game and flaming my teammates whenever they make mistakes i am definitely selfish when i was playing dota2 i was i guess maybe that is from having too much expectation for yourself
i dont understand what you mean by your motivations behind the expectations its that feeling of being haunted everyday that you didnt do enough to reach where you want to go
well good thing that it doesnt happen everyday
i dont know when was the last time i felt like that i think recently i have been actively working towards my goal and good things are happening so that definitely helps
avoiding failures aint good for you
nah never be afraid
you should have went to egypt with stanley oh wait you wouldnt present in that one probably what kind of conference would just let a med student present though
can you remind me what you get out of presenting at a conference unless you are doing it for enjoyment which would be a good reason
i imagine presenting in a conference is much weaker on a resume compared to publishing but something is better than nothing
you are talkinga bout your wet lab experience during undergrad right
lol really what are you doing i am curious
which lab is this at
the pi i mean i want to know what kind of famous person you are working under
are you doing any of his circadian rhythm stuff or are you just doing a side project
if i were you i would spend lots of time reading papers that way you would have more contribution towards the project doing cell staining and counting doesnt seem that interesting
i mean i think you can eventually get to a level where your ideas are valued by your teammates because you just know so much more than them and it certainly beats just counting cells
ya just read it it is interesting work for sure but if it was me working in the lab i would read so much paper
hey i am not telling yo uto do anything i am just speaking from personal experience but good for you if you try out my suggestions
it is also fun to disagree with certain interpretation of observations and papers
lemme know how that goes for you would be fun to try that on your pi lol
i am sure that will be the case
think nothing of it
for sure if i dont ever get back to research in this life i would most certainly try it in another i didnt realize how fun it could have been until well after i quit
yes but the grass is also green where i am now
so i am satisfied with that alright i am gonna go to sleep now dont feel like doing anything anymore for the rest o the day nice chatting with you good night
yo hey havent heard from you in a while life seems ok not very fun right now because i got to write a goddamn boring report how about you
coop report like a fourth year project report kind of thing except it is not very interesting to write
far from fun i was just working in a corporate environment doing what my boss tells me to do i am ready to get the hell out of here lol how is your medical fiction going
did you not use the term fiction last time we talked
or am i not remembering correctly
oh right narrative he told me about it vaguely did you guys have like reports and exams
seems intense well it is intense what am i saying
whats going on outside school for you how is your lab stuff going
what is a lobby day dont explain it i just read it
what political cause did you advocate for
of course but you of all people wouldnt be fearing that would you it is good for stanley though maybe he can thank you later
haha well we say craps like that to each other all the time
i think people are more worried about being matched in a hospital of their liking than the possibility of being matched at all possibility of not being matched at all
that is tough for sure i do worry for him legimately
ya he has been telling me about it he got an interview this coming week with a very prolific researcher in his field of interest great to see him taking the initiative
ya me too anyways have you decided what you are gonna do for summer yet
who is your old pi roth
mind if i ask who this is  i mean i already asked you just now
oh ok so you will be making use of the same network of people you worked with last year
but i remember last year you were not satisfied with your project
no research specimen
did they tell you what you are doing this year
oooh cool so you are continuing with this
nice that sounds pretty positive for you
feels good to have people to appreciate your work
sounds like that to me as well gotta keep that stuff building
yo you mentioned a while back that you occasionally read redditrelationship am i right
oh ok i enjoy reading redditrelationship primarily because it has real stories full of drama and they are amusing to me
i read this interesting story the poster was dating a girl who didnt get into a certain graduate school and was very salty about it i guess we all just grow out of it huh
ya it is natural response i mean there aint no jesus christ in this world no more no matter how you raise a person if the right conditions are present then you can make the person experience jealousy
oooh ok
if your self worth is dependent on your performance and you have always compared yourself to other people to gauge your performance then you would naturally want to see everybody do worse than you
that is a mystery
maybe you can get that kind of malicious intent if you add an external factor that fuels the resentment that comes from being out performed by other people
absolutely
you know what the only thing you got to do in that situation is out perform then harder lol them but it feels like to me that you want to help them
ya staying away would be a good strategy if it was me i would taunt them though sometimes i feel that if you taunt people enough they can realize their issues i dont mean like overt taunting of course
haha ok to be honest i dont think i have actually ever seen anybody in my life that acted maliciously specifically in academic so i am really curious what kind of person your friend is
ye thanks yo how is life
i am too at the moment but i keep getting distracted maybe i should do the same for you
do i use this excuse every time
lol i do procrastinate a lot but i also thought everybody does but anyways do you know if canadian hospitals tend to start their own businesses
are there any precedences of major canadian hospitals starting a business that branch out from their main healthcare service
i was wondering what would happen if i go to a hospital and pitch them a new business idea that use their facilities as a platform like for example a new business revolving around medicine
right that was my hunch as well did you look up that information for me ð³ or did you let my previous inquiry incubate in your head
lol ok how is the conference at nyc
lol i was just kidding it was a wild guess how is nyc
great i like good art too did you go with your friends
i mean thats the people i assumed you went with but i was really asking whether everybody in your group had an appreciation for art
sounds like an awesome group of people to hang out with ð
yo you took chm220 and chm247 back in uoft right
hmmm that is too bad which bch and mgy courses did you take bch242 mgy470 i will keep this direct did you keep the syllabus for any of those courses
can you please dig ðð»
you are back in ssure right
is this for your project in ssure
did you take mgy425
mgy311 oh also thanks by the way for the syllabus
please do
what was 350
oh hell yes do you have the syllabus for that
i am trying to get exemption for a very useless course so i wanna show them that i have taken all of these crazy life science courses and therefore i am smart
i have taken mgy350 all the mgy courses you mentioned
but the syllabus for them are not very informative
so i might just have to ask them to take my words for granted uoft calendar has better description of the courses than the syllabus lol so there is no syllabus for mgy350
no problem
well they are not very organized people to begin with having to take care of their research and all
you might be interested in detroit becomes human httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0aohlws0i0it17396s its a story about androids gaining human emotions
i never watched it before
ya i hear about it from everywhere but this detroit becomes human thoughthis is like something else
because of the history with the blacks there there was this huge parallel it is a story about slavery intelligence and technology
well it is not like it is a 2 hour film since it is a game they have like 10 hours to pull it off
how are you doing
nice
wow really
while you are working
ok
where do you plan on going in japan
hmmmm the top choices
last time i went to tokyo i met some people who just graduated from uoft med lol
you guys are going as a group
oh taht is unfortunate
it is helpful to know japanese but it is not terribly difficult to travel there even if you dont they got english speakers at key travel points all the hostels taht i went to had english speakers
you wont have any trouble reading reading is not a problem because they got english subtitles for all the signs
you should go down there and find out things the hard way yo check out this physics simulator i made for educatinoal purposes httpstianrenwanggithubio
ya you need a real computer
dont worry take your time are you in japan now
whats the most amazing place youve been to so far on the trip
did you go with somebody else it would be kind of awkward to go to a jazz bar by yourself
lol i am sure they wouldnât have cared
and besides they got girls cashiers there
i am surprised you paid that much attention to crowd sensitivity that didnât really stand out to me when i was there
well it is not surprising did you have a chance to see the cram school
i walked past it in shinjuku and students were studying in those spaces i donât know if it was public or rented cram school is exactly what its name suggests you sent a photo
you never see that in canada lol
yo did ssure have its summer project presentations yet nvm found the answer i will be coming but its not like i am coming to see you or anything ok
sorry i realized that most donât know about that joke but ya sure i will be there to grill you on your project
oh dang
ya that was my plan yo are you going to the presentations
oh ok no worries i will go this afternoon to grill on stanleyâs sister who is presenting and then i will be gone
yup
i am at tim horton now
i am at the one next to pgcrl ya letâs do it
we can meet up at pgcrl ya
ya
i am sitting on the couch at the lobby
cool i am waiting
yo happy thanks giving um there are lots of things going on here but overall it is good i havenât travelled or done many enjoyable things though how about you heard your shifts are really busy
nice rhyme are you going to work now
oh so you guys still have lectures while working
cool stuff bet thats an awesome environment to learn medicine aint it
you are going to be a great doctor one day and you will have to save my ass from cancer thats honestly the one unfortunate thing about me leaving biomed i wont be able to cure my own cancer
i was just joking
honda research institute
i research human intelligence and make robots that will conquer the world
welcome friendo i think i am doing good lol keeping myself busy with life hows your clerkship
so do you like interact with kids and stuff
you bet
dissatisfied i thought you might enjoy dealing with kids too knowing your personality i think there is a good chance i will work there
haha dont we all benjamin haibe kains lab he got a lot of money
by the way did you do anything for your birthday i am assuming you celebrated with your friends that was where the photo came from
you looked so incredibly happy in that photo ð
i thought you were angry all the time
of course i jest you just seemed extra happy in that photo which shouldnt even be possible
next year may it seems long but these days time flies by real fast for me
are you guys coming back to toronto at all next summer
if i end up working in toronto next summer i will be lonely
do you know some people there
from your year you mean most of my molgen friends are in sickkids and mount sinai actually i only know 3 of them who are still in toronto
he is hopeless though
he lacks confidence he tells me every time that toronto people are absolute creams of the crop he make it sound like it is hopeless but if he does well during clerkship then maybe he will change his mind
of course i will be waiting for both of you guys while i work at torontoâs google office ð
lol soon as in like in the next few days i am coming back in may i will be in toronto for the summer i imagine you are already back in windsor right
aw poor tina
you are training to be the best doctor you can be nothing sad about that
yo you saw my post about me finished reading that book on chinaâs politics and economy right
i was wondering how much you know about that topic
ok i just saw your comment lol
ya it doesnt look good honestly
how fast do they have to go in that direction what do you consider to be not enough we need to revive deng xiaoping
what do you mean by that the main thing holding china back now is fear of losing control we need their leaders to understand that
right i understand that context now
i actually thought that the end effect of deng and his successors is that most people got out of poverty
i mean what is so bad about income inequality it doesnt mean that people are starving it just means that certain people got rich at least that is the case in china is it not
i mean chinas got 14 billion people
i am not saying they shouldnt try but the fact that vast majority of people got out of poverty is remarkable by itself
right one of the biggest points made in the book is that people in the government are too afraid of losing control all the government controlled companies were far less efficient than private companies
oh ok later i guess
lol sure work hard and be successful
hahaha of course sorry i forgot most people prefer to be happy hey i saw that you read musks biography it has been a while since i last read it though
hahaha or is he asshole when dealing with people sure but he is singlehandedly saving the planet
i remember the book mentioning his terrible treatment of the people around him only a few times though so it is interesting that is the first thing you mention
i think he created a generation of young engineers who wants to be like him but at this point he is living his life to âserve humanityâ so he has to sacrifice lots of happiness to achieve that and most people donât appreciate just what that means for their life
thanks for your thoughtful response tina really appreciate it i think it is reasonable to say that elon musk do love the people around him like i remember the book mentioned near the end that he is the type of person who would seek vengeance on the people who would hurt the people he cares about and he obviously cares for the wellbeing of humanity but people publicly crucifies him for his failure in relationships i think there is a psychological toll on him from people falsely labelling him as an absolute asshole
itâs alright i just got too much free time and am asking too much questions haha
nonono i am still in jap i wouldnât want to be there with the weather
oh shit i am not sure if this has ever been done before but my idea is to take a 3d object and code onto their surface interaction properties like varying in deformability or color
i was ambitiously thinking about making a single object deformable rather than making it out of multiple objects because intuitively that is the best solution or i mean
possibly this is just an idea we dont have to dedicate ourselves to it we might not even form the same team
hmm lets see a magnet has two poles right you can code onto a magnet a force of attraction but in a real magnet there are two forces that act in opposite directions which makes those points behave differently
the real issue is how to code it onto specific points on a 3d shape for that we need to understand how to code 3d models
right the thing is making a simple magnet is not hard we will talk more about this when we meet up again tomorrow
later
yo i am not sure if you realize this but the entire event has no coding i just realized this yesterday it is all about practicing pitching ideas i am not sure if i should attend
ya me too
ok which floor is it
yo i wanna give you a summary of what happened today so in the end my professor pressured me into giving a pitch and i ended up forming a team with a bunch of business and education people
haha you are right but i think i will need your help during the final day you can learn some unity along the way
we got to make a video of what a prototype will look like i personally think he the best way to do it will be in unity
yo sorry for the late reply i definitely need your help we need someone to upload video onto a website website done in html do you think you can help
man sorry about the late response ive been thinking about changing the approach to the entire startup project i just came to the realization that my team is extremely disorganized
we dont have one by the way how did you turn that unity game into a video
oh ok are you coming tomorrow
you arent interested in coming now right
hmm ya come talk to us 30 min
we didnt win anything and the vision got more clear in terms of the business but in terms of actually developing a game nothing happened
ya you know what it would be interesting we can convert some photos into a digital background for a game like how in swapper they turned playdough models photos into actual sprites but ya lets talk more about this
yo i appreciate you looking into all of this stuff but for now i need to take some time to think about what is the most important things needed for the minimal viable product
yo the guy sent you an email just letting you know
hey thanks for reminding but i dont think i am gonna join i dont do competitive games anymore unless it is for fun but chess is serious business yo how did it go with the interview
that seems nice i think i also gotta learn some rr that could be a good goal for me during the winter break
yo the friend you brought with you last time to the club sain if you have his contact can you plz let him know about the club meeting happening tomorrow and by the way have fun at montreal
see ya the place is fss7035 at 1pm tomorrow yo are you interested in doing freelance web design
i got you a potential client i can give that person your email if you want i have no idea what they want though
ok great stuff yo game design club is happening this weekend you didnt miss much from the last time come if you are interested fss7035 1pm
great stuff yo club room tomorrow is at vanier hall 2095
thanks for letting me i will try if i have time yo have you ever tried to create a new object with a constructor in unity
have you ever looked into how to create an object that exist only in memory but not in the scene because apparently every object you create with instantiate needs to be a gameobject that exists in the scene
but like when an instantiation of a prefab is made it exists in the scene right i dont want that
like for example i have a message class and when i make an instance of message object i only want it in memory
right i think that makes sense creating an dictionary i mean i was just checking online and creating inner classes is not recommended in unity thanks for the input
that sounds nice i feel like i got a lot of time till thursday so i am slacking off pretty hard or rather ive being brainstorming and just started working on this months 1 game a month challenge
ya i heard about it in gamasutra i kind of ignored it at first but you seem to be having fun with if it how has your break been so far
just came back from las vegas gonna start working at the end of may full time i got now until then to do my own stuff i will probably get started on blender
do you need to know basic blender to use this tutorial it seems like you do
oh cool right yo by the way did you end up playing in the uottawas chess team just curious about your progress
i think those people who werent showing up to practice were already highly skilled they probably dont even care about attending the tournament because they go to more prestigious tournaments during their own time
are you going to make a game during the summer ya for sure i guess connections count but truthfully speaking they were probably better than you like they were incredibly good players who played everyday its not just uottawa
ya certainly seems good i am hoping to get a mvp ready for my chemistry game but first i will need to learn blender and we got lots of time
i bought the ones that i have now for 5 so maybe not that expensive especially if the shapes are not very complicated hopefully i learn how to make chemistry assets while learning blender
i know this guy his tutorials are not very beginner friendly because he only uses hotkeys you dont know what he is doing once you get lost
well i would just get used to the interface there are some free tutorials on blender homepage do them get used to the hotkeys and start following someone like blender guru no need for courses
oh ya its up to you i am just very frugal when it comes to money
ya that is another major limitation
for sure gonna start today after i talk to some people on fb
thats good to know i am learning blender now pretty basic stuff
nice man i am still following the blender tutorial on youtube this is my latest creation lol it is not working you sent a photo now it is wjat wjat whats the tutorial you are following
i think i will eventually move onto that myself but the donut tutorials talk about some very basic stuffs i wanted to get down the basics before i move onto something advanced like character
i am sure you will get there eventually if you follow the tutorials
i see i dont know whether i will eventually reach that stage because what i am doing now is all about recreating scenes that are based on reality
i see you were talking about the technical aspects that would certainly be great learning on your own is quite slow i am also thinking about taking this architectural course online but it is a whupping 300
lol goddamn you are hardcore
well tell me how it goes after you finish it
i didnt have that before but my most recent ones started having that problem too or maybe it just wasnt that noticeable
ya it is pretty cool
thanks man but honestly at this point i have learned enough basics for me to start doing stuffs on my own
ya i got so bored of watching the videos
there is no trick you just save the blend file in the asset folder and you can directly open the blend file in the project as a 3d asset
i recommend you have a thickness for every object you make so you dont have to worry about normal you can add thickness by adding solidify modifier
it is complicated but you can figure that stuff out on your own
that looks really good man
thanks i try my best i am doing architecture next the guys architecture renders looked real good
thanks for the message dude i will check it out when i got time i think the transformation you talked about was done in an indie game about life and shit
looks cool man did you just recently start that unity project
i see hope it goes well for you man dont give up half way through like i did lol
you already did huh i havent given up that much yet mostly because i havent started that many but it is a shitty feeling thanks to my new work and other commitments
well i think i follow a similar work flow but i like to think i am more resistant to giving up than most people ð i just need a reason to work on something
i cant afford that much money now
starting next monday i actually have no idea how interesting it is going to be because being begged makes me feel good
haha ya wouldnt that be nice but the biggest thing for me now is that i get into a field of work that i can dedicate myself too
that would be good i think that is easier to find than an actual game dev position since it requires less artistic skills
ya no doubt about that but it is more suited for us to do more computational stuffs since we have no formal training in art but goddamn it i want to get into art
oh seriously thats wicked how many courses are you taking 4
wish there was a digital art course in ottawa
at this point in my life i am not interested in acclimating myself to pencils and paints lol i think we should have gone to carlton they probably have more courses that we would like
ya algonquin i know somebody from al she is a professor there and she seemed like a real artist like an actual industrial artist yo i am gonna go to sleep now it was nice talking to you
later son
there are many stories out there like that the swapper is another good example of game made by college students
nope never seen it i will think about participating but i already have set my priority for this summer
i agree with you absolutely just saying i got some priorities i gotta worry about
lol i have no inspiration now though i wanna learn how to make beautiful house interiors for games right now but you should sign up for itchio though you seem to be pretty active
oh nice i have been working like mad over my blender kitchen it is pretty addicting stuff once you get into it rather i am playing soma now it is a great atmospheric horror game
ya that is a problem but i thought you have a pretty good pc at your house
man all the good games on on pc are on but zelda is still pretty good i heard are you still working on the blender course for game design the one that you had to pay for
lol you didnt pay for that one right
isnt that kind of a waste not to add insult to injury or anything well i do feel for you that you had to go through with that
well sounds like you know what you are doing so now that you came out of the wolfram summer camp are you like an expert in math or something
lol that feeling when you realize you learned more useful stuff from a summer camp than from taking an entire year of course on computer science
well i cant exactly blame the university because it is a system catered to the masses but for people like you and i we are much better off learning stuffs on our own
well that is because of the property of implication a  a is always true as we learned in class but for obvious reasons we cant say that any a is true thats how i would think about it
that stuff is far beyond my understanding at this point but i am sure you can make good use of your new found idea
you should watch somebody play pt pt features a pseudoinfinite looping mechanism
in the same way you described your doll house oh wait sorry it is not exactly the same as your doll house it is more like the portal looping so this is my latest render you sent a photo
oh hell ya man some cheese the thing is i spent countless hours perfecting the kitchen but i havent spent anytime on the rest of the house
see ya son yo hows it going currently bored out of my mind at work
i dont have that problem in my case but it is more like my boss sometimes asks for too much and at the current moment she is so busy that i have nothing to do
what is this oh i get it it is a bunch of programming problems framed in some kind of light hearted narrative
lol you can do it right now you have free time dont you
goddamn son that looks legit i should honestly do a portfolioesque thing too people have been telling me to make one
i got it for free i downloaded it
oh wow
how does this stuff even work though the problem for me is that i got coop the list of companies that i can work for is limited but it is still worth a try
ya possibly worth a try
winter it is fast approaching and i made an agreement with the coop program about my participation i highly doubt that i can actually do this but i will try anyways yo by the way
are you interested in taking on another game project right now because i recently started one and creatively speaking it seems promising of course i say that because i came up with the idea lol
not at the moment it is at the level design stage to validate the playability of the game we might get one problem in the future regarding object reflections in the environment in the future
oh ya thats nice i would surely participate
is that supposed to be like a real time strategy kind of game i remember seeing something like that before
right it was probably that well good for you man i like the minimalistic design of the game but i dont see how the gameplay is that much different from phage wards wars
well yes creativity is a result of old ideas thought about in a new way but execution is honestly jsut as important
ya me too guess we are not good enough for them yet hey i have a question for you how did you upload the games we made back in the game design club onto the internet
how do you export the project to browser
i just did that i have the indexhtml
so it loads the page but the game doesnt run
goddamn i will try safari then nice it did run i will host the game on githut then yo did they take attendance at todays compsci class
ok good i skipped todays class to meet with a game developer
haha ok i was gonna spend some time reviewing the lecture slides but i guess that wont be ncessary
well i will eventually be doing that but maybe not necessarily immediately yo do you know of any good hackathons to attend nearby or any happening this semester
nice
yo how do you sign up for ieee
lol
so is the google doc the only thing i need to fill in i am not even an ieee member
ok great stuff thanks for the info man
yo did you go to capital gaming expo this year
i think the only point of going to these conferences is to showcase your own projects at least for us
i see yo i forgot to ask you did shahaan tell you that we are organizing a game jam
if we run a game jam for uottawa students are you interested in being a volunteer to help people out with technical stuffs like unity
oh hell nawww you need to be in a team then and you can help others learn unity while you jam do you think a 12 hour jam is enough or do you think longer jams are better
tell that to shahann
what did you write for the essays i was gonna apply for it but then the essays kind of bumped me off
yo i saw your post on seg
did you find any difference between abstract and nonabstract like any difference and how did you measure the difference
i found that they are the same when i am reporting their median value on average there is no difference between abstract and no abstract but i noticed that abstract inherited classes takes less time in certain situations
i am reporting the maximum and minimum amongst all function calls i am not doing batches i am recording the time for each call of each batch and then i am doing the maximum and minimum of the batch
that is interesting i have to see your code for this but you are saying that all of your calls practically run at the same speed there is no variation in them is what you are suggesting
thanks man it is fwang100uottawaca yo when is the ieee extreme and do you know when the midterm for csi2110 is
oh hell ya son thansk a lot yo is there any chance that i can drop out of this
oh i see yo i got a question for you
for the uml diagram did you put functions for each class this is seg we are talking about
key methods are not getter and setter right
alright thanks yo is the professor talkinga bout avl this lecture
do you think you will get to avl you know what i will read about it anyways but lemme know if they end up talking about avl
alright thanks buddy
ahh i see that was important i remembered to do it when i programmed that question yo i got a question about csi oh ok i get it it is more complex than it initially seemed
no it doesnt have to be imagine this min heap 1 2 6 4 5 8 7 the smallest would be 1 2 and 4 but 4 is not the child of the root
good thing i asked lol
oh wait yes indeed hey buddy how was seg midterm
oh shit capital gaming i am surprised the course allowed you to defer it to the final
right
it was alright so for this latest test i ended up not studying too much for it but i felt i did decent on the test
csi definitely ceg as well yo i just got a question for you man do you understand question 3f for the data structure assignment 3
i have no idea i dont usually check for these kinds of stuffs other people who are more tryhard than i am usually find them if i ever see somebody post the midterm somewhere i will let you know
alright thanks yo are you going to hackwestern 4
nice i am going to
guess we will be seeing each other yo did you finish assignment 2 for csi
for part 1 did you pass the test where you insert a large string under 500 ms
ok alright that worked splendidly thank you for the info calling the substring actually requires copying each character from the substring into a new memory slot which is actually on2
its gotta be slower than that is it not sorry on to copy but you have to do that copying n times which makes the whole process on2
anyways i am gonna go down to the exam location now see you in a bit
same yo i got a question for you for assignment part 2 for csi2110 of course for test 2 do you agree with the expected number of nodes in the compressed tree
isnât the root supposed to be removed during the compression since it is not used to store data
lol why were people complaining that the correct number is 3 the correct number is 2 the root doesnât store any data and it only has one child that stores data so it should be replaced by that child
thatâs because people were complaining for their shit algorithms no where in the instruction does it say that root is an exception and it makes so much sense to just remove the root without exception if it doesnât store any data
whatever i am submitting my answer as it is donât give a shit about those dumbasses crying about the 2 node by the way did you guys finish avl on tuesday
wth you guys did pivots which lecture  is that did you guys do more sorting algorithms
wait lecture 9 doesnât do anything with pivots
ok
thanks for the info buddy yo i need some advice from you what kind of custom tests did you write for csi assignment 3 the test they used seemed pretty complete the default tests i mean
right that comprehensive part gets me
most test cases look for simple but weird cases
that sure would be nice now wouldnt it lol so csi2110 now accepts two answers for that compressed node the removal of the root that does not store a string is in fact correct
we got the entire friday night and saturday night
i am considering booking a motel over the weekend two nights you wanna share it would cost us 60 per person in total nah it is already sold out that doesnât exist anymore
i might bring my entire bed set with me lol that is no good you know that right
if you can sneak in even 4 hours of sleep somewhere that is infinitely better than none anyways i think i am well prepared for this lots of unity people looking for a team now for hackwestern
but you need to have at least some kind of game play with that right walking simulator itself cant qualify unless you add lots of content to it
i mean what else can you do in your game other than walk around no mans sky made a procedurally generated game and you know how that ended that in itself is a worthwhile goal in my opinion
hey look i am not saying that walking simulator are bad games in fact i enjoy some of them myself but i am gonna do some research on this proteus
of course that is my end goal too
i will also probably wait but i want to get somebody to help me make my game if i end up going for my idea and for that reason it is important to start contacting people
that sounding smart part is certainly real lol yo have you done assignment 4 do you know what they mean by a broken line
by the edges the edges are directed so you are supposed to infer from them the line path i also just noticed one station can have two different numeric ids those different numeric ids are associated with different lines
lol that is awesome
thanks man i am still on the first question
first one is not that hard but i got to look into the second one
well i am making the assumption that every vertex has either 1 or 2 edges going out of it and those edges are the ones that are in the same line oh i forgot to mention
well sort of but i dont think about the problem in terms of any kind of special search
in what case would you get a fork structure the definition of a line is that it goes in one direction and it has no forks
i mean it doesnt say that anywhere on the assignment but it is a reasonable assumption jesus christ you are right
but like
how does she expect us to print that then
alright seems reasonable i will skip it too aint no end to bullshit in this course eh
i am gonna hit the sack noe later man
so i just found out that the yellow line you showed me does not exist in the text file she gave us this might be an attempt of her to eliminate branched lines
whats your idea for the 3rd question oh wait you can technically just remove that vertex
if you remove the vertex wouldnt that take care of that problem it is the same as question 2 but with one less vertex is it not
i just realized that if you had implemented this whole assignment using the adjacencymapgraph provided in past labs you can get the list of incoming and outgoing edges of an vertex you sent a photo
i am no longer working on the project lol i have my partner helping me with that but thanks for the input i will send this over to him
awesome thanks for the info still working on seg
yo hvae you tried out some of the test cases they had for a4 some of them dont make any sense
well try n1  371 n2  372 and then try n1  371 n2  372 n3  6 i get the same result for bboth of these but the test cases they gave us give different results
ok so you get the same as me and i am going to ignore the test cases
thanks for the info buddy but i am taking care of seg now yo remember question 3 for csi a4 we compared answer and we got the same thing that was the incorrect asnwer because we misunderstood the assignment
we were supposed to ignore the entire line that was associated with that station that we want to ignore we mistook that station as just a simple unavailable station
we got really confused at some of the stuffs the assignment pdf file mentioned but it also clearly mentions that we want to ignore the entire line not just the station
lol thats harsh buddy yo have you done the dijkstras algorithm question for assignment 5 or i mean are there multiple answers for that question
ok so my actual probblem with this question is that some people have degree of separation of more than 1 but the question doesnt tell you who is the middle man and if it doesnt tell you the middle man then there is no way to tell the connectivity between the people
ok that makes sense i was considering doing it in a more exhaustive way but was surprised to find that the table doesnt provide the complete information anyways i think i understand now after your explanation
it is honestly a very beautiful game and the next game they are making seems really good too httpsinthevalleyofgodscom
alright cool what did you get for q4 i got jean  luce  ali  emma
great
thanks for the info hey man how is life treating you
cusec huh i dont know what you did there but when i went there last year it felt like convergence of all of the more sociable people who like to drink beer all day not all were good though
nice i want to know whether you are interested in doing a firstperson puzzle game
also we need to get 2 other people at least maximum of 4
httpslfacebookcomlphpuhttps3a2f2fglobalgamejamorg2f20182fjamsites2fottawagamejamhatpljm0ufy3iyqko5qzd21shw4wgycpziftmaeqxqsyyed6lenl7k50zkqd41gxktngbw1ffh5x2qvujdtt9g23vlg6mv97wcttlslnjkllalt8wzfjr3uh2cw9elo3ldnhtqkfys1encazmvhynsnjqbjbygo8w1zhjwtpygrefya2w2zd23yb27znahpnwz8i30oqiyf7imvvkhb7oty0mahooeibyzz
it is better with people who are more experienced and takes initiative ask around for some and i will ask around too in the meantime i am going to come up with the rough idea of the puzzle game
we can do that
i will talk to you later i am working now
so it turned out the ggj has a theme every year so it is not very easy to prepare for them other than just studying game dev skills we should just gather as many talented individuals as possible
yo hows it going game jam this weekend gonna be good
ya it is going to be fun fun two weeks i am getting rejected from a lot of hackathons i think they are discriminating me for being a game dev lol did you manage to recruit anybody
well we might find some at the game jam i am also gonna do some practice of old blender skills we dont got time to do that during the jam what else do you think are worth learning
fair that will be the tool that is going to be most used amongst us it might be good if you do some research on image postprocessing do you knwo what that is
no thats not what i meant but at the end of the day postprocessing might not be useful if we are making 2d games it is great for making 3d games that make the view look prettier
shaders is a big part do you know how to make shaders
lol is it hard to make shaders i never looked into it
so much stuffs to learn so little time
but for this game jam i am more interested in creating that is good gameplay wise
all of these graphics thing shouldnt be a huge concern alright i am going to sleep good night
yesterday i downloaded the substance package with the student license i think i am gonna learn it over the next few days in case i need it during the game jam
lo lare you the one who made it or just save me a spot in whatever team you find
yo can you give me your number so i can call you later today
i am gonna go there very soon actually when will you be there
alright
i am going by bus so will be there at 5
i will be there 450 before
what do they use and what soft work do you recommend and what are their other skillsets do they like game design
we can have up to 6 people so having two additional teammates doesnât necessarily restrict us in anyway even if they only contribute to game ideas
right you can ask them to learn unity we might have 3 good unity users on our team so teaching them the ropes might not be too hard
yo tell me your ggj username
no it is not you need to enter from the library street
import this file using unity editor you sent an attachment i am giving up working on materials you sent an attachment but this is the final version you sent an attachment you sent an attachment transformpositiony using unityenginescenemanagement
anything new since i left
for the test chambers we can go for something that is not reflective it is the reflections that really mess things up or we can get some free online assets to make things look sleeker
you sent an attachment you sent an attachment hey can you make a post on fb about our participation in the game jam and a link to our game if you dont want to do it i can
can you send me the githubio link
yo have you ever used the vertexfragment shader in unity
like a user interface
there is no video dude did you set the video to private
dude i have been following the tutorial of somebody who has made something basically the exact same as yours but i want to make a mirror instead of a portal like what you made here
i see for a second i thought you had the answer to my question the general code is working but there is a slight problem with the way the mirror behaves that makes it unrealistic
the simple idea for making a mirror is to have another camera generate the texture and use a shader to control which part of the texture to put onto the plane that will be the mirror
pass 		 			cgprogram 			pragma vertex vert 			pragma fragment frag 			 			include unitycgcginc  			struct appdata 			 				float4 vertex  position 				float2 uv  texcoord0 			  			struct v2f 			 				float2 uv  texcoord0 				float4 vertex  svposition 				float4 screenpos  texcoord1 			  			float4x4 actualmatrix  			v2f vert appdata v 			 				v2f o 				overtex  mulactualmatrix vvertex 				overtex  unityobjecttoclipposvvertex 				oscreenpos  computescreenposovertex 				return o 			 			 			sampler2d maintex   			fixed4 frag v2f i  svtarget 			 				iscreenpos  iscreenposw 				fixed4 col  tex2dmaintex float21  iscreenposx iscreenposy 				 				return col 			 			endcg
ok i will you sent an attachment but if you dont know much about shader you will probably have a really hard time understanding it i might just go to udemy to learn unity shader lol httpswwwudemycomunityshaders
ya that is like way down the line unfortunately i hope i can get to that stage lol
ya they got everything that game developers would want lucky them in uottawa we got limited resources
well i am sure we can do that but i think that is an incredible inconvenience i think you can learn just as much about shaders from this udemy course and it is 23 online
you should get it now only 23 ð
wtf that is weird did you ever take udemy courses before
lol that is some fucked up repugnant shit and yes i did have lots of udemy shader course ad on youtube
ok i will try and i think i will pay for it if it is only 15 we should still be learning stuff the incognito mode didnt work
that still doesnt make any sense we are in the same country
i wonder if i had a udemy account before maybe i did still 23 but whatever i will still take it i might just finish it tomorrow lol
hopefully man but i think if i am going to continue with game dev this could be a good course for the long run
ya cuz they are all pussies and dont want to pay for udemy unity shader course
yo happy birthday man are you actually 28 years old i thought you were like two years younger than me
lol dude all this time i thought you were like born in 1994 i was born in 1992 i should stop saying son to you
i only learned about the shader because i wanted to solve a specific problem i fixed that problem in the end and i probably didnt even need shader knowledge to fix it how is your summer so far
dude congrats microsoft is top tier do you have access to a vehicle cuz it is pretty hard to reach hiking trails without one dude how are you doing man check out this web app i made using unity
actually unity uses newton as si unity unit so the standard unit for mass is kg and speed is in ms max speed huh i think it was something like 59999ms
i think anything at 500ms or above will cause that dude how are you doing man i got a programming question for you you sent a photo
stringbuffer is supposed to solve the problem theoretically but i havenât actually tried but it is a satisfactory solution for me this is from google by the way i am applying for their summer internship
thanks man i might actually try it out later those are some high impact courses though
if you wanna work in good companies you need those skills
nope i donât have time to do that stuff nowadays cuz i am applying to jobs preparing for interview and thinking about work after work kind of tough right now
lol ok man i am gonna get back to work now so talk later
yo has any of your classes taught you majority of this stuff or do you think we gotta learn this stuff on our own httpswwwcodementorioblogjavainterviewsamplequestionsanswersdu107xs23
i asked that question because i was worried that google might ask me some of these questions but after doing the interview code challenge i realized it wasnt very necessary
where the fuck is this happening at and when is it happening i am not in north america until the end of next year april
oh ok i will only see you for one semester after going back to school what are you going to focus on after graduatino like web development backend programming machine learning
i was hoping that we collaborate on something in future you are the only good programmer that i know in uottawa lol but maybe that will be difficult with you gone
i am glad to hear that but i donât actually care that much about games anymore i am spending all my time here in japan studying ml this is a much more important technology that can shape the future
great shit
what are the games goddamn if we are doing dota2 then i would be down should we get all the last 5 tickets get 5 man doto
i know a few people lemme ask around
yo i will go to the event but dont think i can get anybody else with me
it is up to you i will go down there myself regardless of your attendance
ya i can guarantee you i will go
buying it right now calm ur tits
oh shit how do you refund it
i think it is better that we get refund
i am gonna go out for a bit give me the info for it after i come back
yo how do i get that visitor post to the front page post on our fb page
oh cool i think i am out for tonight check out my post and see you tomorrow
well i can tell him to come in if he wants but like are there things that we need him for we can practically teach unity ourselves lucia also uses unity
how are you going to use that professional credibility
you want him to be the one giving the presentation i can tell you now that guy is literally a dead person he has a heavy accent and doesnt act enthusiastically during teaching
i think we needed to have talked about this in more detail in the group meeting
are you sure about this if you think this change is important we gotta meet up tomorrow the other thing i wanted to mention was that we should have had this meeting last week wednesday instead of today
ya
ok
yo regarding the ta and we are planning this then we gotta at least give the ta a week advance notice so he can prepare material
ya but in this case he isnt he is a dead person
alright i am gonna go hit the sack good night
yo you still down at 1pm
meet me next to tim horton at site at 1pm
son where are you
oh lawd jesus
when are you gonna get here
lol alright
yo lets talk here i dont want to swamp common chat
alright
do i got to go book them rooms
are we booking room this saturday
depends are we satisfied with making games or do we want to also create a gaming community these two communities are kind of different
alright then we need to try fss and are we gonna book this week as well
lets test out fss immediately should book it this week
ok am i suppose to talk to sfuo
probably not
why morriset i can try fss
oh i see do you have a room in mind
we need a room with battery outlet lots of them
ok
yo did you submit the form yet
what you got
oh hell no
fucking goddamn alright i am gonna run the club again at cby but i want you to take care of the club announcements and stuff also did you get the form in
you put that announcement down on facebook when we are having the meeting
whatever you got planned for this week
i dont know jackshit about concept building at least level design
yo if you can submit the form this week you should do it this week
i am expecting the form submitted before you go
so on saturday all we are doing is getting peoples ideas
ok yo can you put a post on the facebook page about this weeks meeting i already booked the usual room at the usual time
ok great
great shit we will talk about how to use this shit on wednesday
thats right 8 hour sessions
yes
you wont know until you try and i am sure we discussed this before
the thing is last time we spent like close to four hours talking about game ideas and actually working on the game we could reduce it down to 33 but i think we definitely need more than two hours
i have already thought up of stuffs to do for the meeting but i think the most important of them is getting people up to speed with github
i am an idiot i dont know how i missed that
but i did write saturday next to it so hopefully people realized
yo sorry for asking you for this again but can you help me look up the vems login for our club
yes i know the password is uorangegdcarrot16 but if the login id is the uogdc email then the login is not working
i am gonna check with the reservation people tomorrow to see whats up if i cant request it online then i will request the booking in person
i think i will still go talk to them directly to see if we can get the room this saturday i will record down the login though
reserving electronically is too slow if it turns out to be slow i will book the room at cby
hey it seems like we wont be able to book fss for the next meeting but we can have it at cby
i will see if we can book fss after next week no booking it now is too late for the system i sent one of the organizers and email to extend our booking of the room to every week
dude the workshop will happen at cby that is for sure i am talking about the saturday meetings
oh ok i will check with then tomorrow the workshop still happens at 6pm tomorrow i am gonna sleep now so later
yo what is happening this weekend are we gonna cancel or gonna run the club
ok so i should cancel
no we did not man check the convos
we didnt even meet after the last meeting but its cool
whatever man
it was 100 for the first semester
ya
83 is still not bad you should at least submit an application doesnt take long literally 5 minutes
there is a deadline though you got to submit it within this month i think you got maybe 10 more days left
good luck son just to give you an idea though there are plenty of people with less than 83 gpa in software i am sure i know one guy failed first semester calc
ya i know but there is still a chance the fact that you have higher grade than some of them should give you some hope
hey can you put up the uogdc event
hey dude i still dont see the post on fb
i see
tell them to invite their friends too
the good one
did they reply back by the way
ok great
alright i will be waiting
ok
there wont be enough time well not dota at least
will you separate the people in different groups or we do all that together
ok i dont have a problem with that
7035 can you play games in thqt room you sent a photo
ya you told me that before
yes oh i didnt see your message
one more guy is coming i dont know man
lol
i think we should develop more assets
ya that too
ok so are we dojng a meeting tomorrow
do it quick otherwise i wont be able to book a room
ok
cby 707 i will go talk to them after my class
yea
room is booked
yes
are you fucking serious why did he say yes then we asked him yesterday
ok well the room is booked do you know anything you want to do with it
i will go there to study and work if you wanna hang out you are more than welcomed to come
6 to 8
when is it
i will see if i have time i do have time but i dont respect it that much you just wear formal clothes and they take a picture of you
do you need to book
do you know how big is the lineup
i am eating at the cafeteria today i will wear some nice clothes
and if the lineup is short then i will take it
yo are we gonna have a workshop this wednesday
does he have stuffs ready
i think you can continue with unity
ok if you can get it done in an hour then sure but i think you guys will go over time
ok make a post on fb please
yo the room is ste2001
yo did you include the location on the post i dont see it
ok good stuff yo the location of the session this saturday is 2095 vanier hall
couldnt get the fss room i tried to book it weeks in advance but still couldnt get it
hey are you going to make a fb post for the saturday event i spoke to a few people today and some people who saw the event on fb for the workshop were actually interested
ok and people are not getting notifications cuz they forgot to like the page it is different from joining a group the unintuitiveness of joining may have costed us some members
i am just letting you know
is there a way for people to convert our group into a joinable group
maybe we should turn it into a group
because it is intuitive to join a group
some people dont know that you have the like the page to get notifications
join it
sorry they dont do anything you know what maybe it low sample size i mean we got a lot of likes on the page
i only asked one person
but there are interests amongst nonregulars so make that fb event
ok
ok
yes we are gonna need power adaptors only 3 in the whole room
it is an unknown room i thought you knew better
nobody is here yet
ya i decided to stop doing that cuz sometimes the rooms are not open
i will be coming
it is a google hosted competition for programmers i was planning to do it but i am not in the mood to do it today
i will be coming dont worry
no one is here yet except of me and ib
broodstarfrankhotmailcom
i am in i need the team members emails
alright i am in
ya
alright

yo somebody in ottawa needs to go check on the specifications of the computer our client is using so i can decide how i am programming the software can you add that to somebodys task
tanks
alright
ok ya sure
ya lemme find it yo i dont think i ever took those notes they were just all in my head
and i also cant attend today cuz i will be on my way back home when we have the meeting or working
he is my buddy please treat him nicely
he is the guy who wants to organize a game jam at carlton we should get him involved
yes
not yet is it the same channel as last year
i was always skeptical about that idea of 12 hour because i am for longer jams
tes yes
i believe a b and c are all true
s has a p l e thats 4 elements
a belongs to s but a does not get it
a is not the same as a
yes
the symbol they are using is subset that is different from belongs apl is a subset of s
they are not asking you for subset for b they are using the belong sign
in b they are stating a does not belong to s which is true
welcome
why are you doing it now
oh i see

great anything fun
nice tell me what you learned
int x  0 you know what that means
you will get there
you did not draw this did you  waitdid you actually draw this hello
its cool
please explain
yup it is pretty simple
what if you write int x  0 x  x  1 what is x
you are learning
programming is so easy if you understand the basics
you have break fast at 11am
that is a late breakfast sure go ahead
enjoy your meal
today i finished writing the story that ive been workign on for the past two weeks read it if you are interested i just gotta warn you there is a lot of mature contents in this
i am back
we moved to our boarding gate
i am a little embarassed ð
i think there were some stuffs in the text that are very mature
no i was the one who wrote them all of it
it was originally written for a game challenge to write a game with a story
did you understand it
alright lol i dont know if it is a good or a bad thing you only understood a little ð
ya please actually please dont read it
i dont want you thinking i am a weird person
i swear i am not lol
thanks for understanding ð what is your plan for today
are you the diligent one arent you
not sure maybe like 200
ya just checked the cheap ones are around 200
more expensive ones are 400
is it too expensive for you
haha they are robbing you
are you thinking about playing cello
oh wow your mother wants you to do everything
you should focus on one thing at a tome or a few things as possible
do you have students to tutor zheng
what is the market like in ottawa
you should do some research first maybe you can post on craigslist
you can try looking for them my personal impression is that most local people might not be interested in chinese instruments
there might be a big market in toronto though because there are lots of chinese people in toronto sorry for bursting your bubbleð
but you are surprisingly optimistic i like that are you trying to say something
ya that is most definitely true you want to avoid doing labor work have you tried to look for jobs in your field
how was the result of your search
how many resumes did you send sorry you are saying that there arent that many positions available right
that is too bad
did you get any interviews
ok sounds like you do need more experience but what kind of experience do you need for that
oh really
who are these people classmates
aah i see
you know maybe it is hard for you now because you only just finished your first year but for next year you can definitely work on a few things to improve your chance i can help advice you advise
yup maybe look for them during school year everybody got to start somewhere
nice if you cant find a volunteer place maybe you can do some personal projects in your field i dont know whether it is possible to do personal project in your field but you should look into it
have you talked to professors for potential volunteer or work placements
lol learn programming does that actually help in your field
i see then i think you better start learning it if that is the casemaybe learn c is better than c because c is more popular or java anyways you got the whole summer to learn this
you are my girlfriend of course i would encourage you i wish for your success
me too i might come visit you a week after you get back to ottawa
me too ð
haha that is a nice goal you can definitely do it i can assure you one month is a lot of time
and someone of your intelligence level should have no problem
i love you very much sara
color of rose
lol i am shaking with excitement
it is hard i want to take it easy but i am so into you right now
i will take a deep breath
ur gonna eat me girl
how will you cook me stir fry
boil haha i feel like a happy man now
i never expected you to be attracted to me it was very surprising when you asked me out
no it is the right word
i have finally calmed down
happens to me every time something extraordinary happens
also happens in competitions lol you too
alright sara i am gonna sign off for now to rest up i will be thinking about you on my sleep tonight in
thanks
me too sara love you
ð i just got back home but i am going to sleep because i am too tired
later
have fun yo whats up
what did you guys eat
tremella you know a lot of plants and fungus
yes i know you did
i rested most of today and i watched my mother make dough for dumpling i am gonna try making it myself next time
i just slept stayed in bed thought about my plans for the rest of the month
haha nice will you learn from your mother
the stuffing hey maybe you can learn how to make the inside i will learn how to make the dough then we can combine our skills
oh ya you mentioned about them
ya makes sense
i can keep you company if you are bored
i am bored myseld
ð i spent some time learning 3d modelling software today
i got bored after 20 minutesð
just some basica software interface
i spent about 20 minutes and got bored i will probably go back learning after this conversation
thats good haha knowing that i feel like i should work as hard as you
i think it is a good thing
confusing
ya i understand what you mean what are you confused about maybe i can explain
english words
10 is a good number if you are good at studying
you think that is too low
ok so you encounter 60 new words a day you can take 10 of the most important words and memorize them
spend more time recognizing words than memorizing them
when you see a word understand how that word fit in the context of the sentence dont make new sentences just observe how other people use those words and learn from it
ya just spend time understanding the meaning of a word in a sentence
great i think your english will get better and better
i can guarantee you
your english will improve faster the more english speaking friends you have and having an english speaking boyfriend will certainly help
ð i am so happy that you like me so much
i wish i can hold you right now it is painful to think that i cant see you for an entire month
your beautiful pictures yes please
go on doesnt matter whether you look dumb or smart in the picture
wow is that your dog
oh ok you sent a photo have you seen this photo
i have a really stupid photo i am not sure if i should show it to you
promise me that you wont get mad
promise me
you sent a photo ð
awww
show your parents that your boyfriend is an idiot with this photo ð now i want to see your selfies
i see it now but you look so sad did you take it just now
please show me after you take them
i think i am gonna get back to work now this was a good break
have fun learning how to make dumpling
ð
i sure will
yo what up i am not asleep yet how was your day
oh really what kind of internship
ahh ok you got about 24 days left
that will be a challenge
it would be great if you can find some experience
do you have any places in mind that you can volunteer at in china
well you can definitely ask him it doesnt hurt to ask
when my mother used to look for work in ultrasound she had to get some experience in china first before she found a job in canada so what you are doing now is a valid strategy
but 24 days is really short
maybe you can volunteer for 2 weeks
dont worry about it
dont stop yourself from changing flight just because your boyfriend is in canada
you can find a good one if you try really hard and show your enthusiasm in learning
yes of course
thats the right attitude today i learned some 3d modelling it was surprisingly easy i will start practicing making my own shapes
ya i will i only spent about 1 hour studying though lol i had 16 hours
lol no it is not efficient i need to find a way for me to focus for at least 5 hours maybe it will get better as i make more shapes
haha ya
but there is a way i am sure are you planning for anything fun in the next few days you mentioned you will go meet your friends right
hmm sounds like you are confident in getting the internship ð i am glad you feel that
i really hope you do find a position there
that would propel your career by so much ð
but if you do delay your flight i will definitely miss you
i am really looking forward to what we have planned for ourselves
hehehe for sure
me too sara we should have honestly spent more time together before we left but that might have been forcing the relationship too quickly
well we didnt really have much romantic interaction until 2 weeks before we left even though we knew each other we didnt know each other personally
i am a shy boy it takes time for me i am not really used to being liked by somebody else
i am glad i chatted with you afterward one of the best decisions i made in my life
i am serious ð i want our relationship to be successful
do you mind me asking you what exactly went wrong
right and you mentioned before that you didnt put much effort in your previous relationships
were they the ones who initiated to date you
maybe you just didnt like them that much i dont want to sound rude
hmmm i guess you learn from these experiences regardless of whether you fail or succeed
i guess i am lucky then that i am dating you after you learned your lesson lol
i told you before that i didnt date any girls before but i have to apologize because that is a white lie
there was this girl i got along with some 3 years ago and i learned some stuffs about relationship from that experience
ya
fellow classmate good grades
ya we got along for 2 months but completely stopped afterwards i wasnt ready to explain to you after dinner that day but i just want to put this out in the open now so you know
no 2 months but that happened 3 years ago
there wasnt much love in that relationship like we have for each other now ð
i feel like we love each other too much ð
are you typing something
ð³
sorry i am not very familiar with female biology did that happen just now period i mean
you should rest then i wish i could be there to comfort you now but you will have to do with a digital version of me ð
oh he just came to your house
that is no problem good luck on finding the internship i hope your uncle can get it for you love you sara
so did your uncle say anything
ohhh you will get the result tomorrow
i hope you get it
oh so somebody already offered you a position
ya i think so too
no problem you can wait and see which one offers you but the one your uncle is helping you with sounds cool
yeah you might have a higher chance of getting into your uncles because he is related to you
ive been to a few places and connections is truly important
ya
same thing in china
i dont mean that connection is everything but if you have connection it can help you get the position much easier in the end you still need to be good at what you do
well anyways i hope you get that position
my friends yesterday asked me to join their future company ð as a software developer
ya basically  but they are mostly 1st and 2nd year students
they dont know anything about running a business they only have the product
i am not really interested in their project but i want to help them temporarily and see where it takes me one of the team member is an exec of the game design club
oh ya why is that
did you submit a program change request
you should look into it right now
there is a deadline for submitting program changes
there is a certain date you have to submit it by
for undergrad program changes we had to submit by april 1st
not sure for graduate programs
send an email right now or look into program changes in graduate study you can still submit one by august but they cant guarantee a spot i think
just look into it
i dont know the details ð gogogogo i am going to be back in 10 minutes i am back
oh ya sure sorry i didnt see your msg for some reason i think you have to send an email to the graduate office because they dont seem to have a template process for switching in graduate study
did you find a way
laptop
you are welcome sara i know if you go to your uozone there is an application that lets you change program you can see if that works
chinese internet lol
take it easy you can still apply after you come back to canada
do you want me to look it up for you
i guess email then
good night sara sweet dream yo whats up
good old dumpling
i did a bunch of house keeping work played some dota2
and reviewed some of the stuffs i learned yesterday i cut my hair too
ok sure you sent a photo hair is messy because i took a nap after taking a shower hey i am gonna go to sleep i will talk to you in 8 hours after i wake up love you

this is my progress so far i think i am gonna learn more stuffs today
how was your day
thats good you best prepare yourself
nice you are gonna get busy is it from 9am  5pm
that means you cant stay in bed anymore in the morning
i just found someone who is looking for a parttime unity developer i might participate in that
i hope i get that job
thanks
what form
how did you get the form did they send you an email
oh so that means you can probably switch right
nice that is great news
i am very happy for you
i guess you really do have to prepare for next semester since you have missed a lot of courses
do you know when you will hear back from them probably in june before course selection
ok when do you plan on coming back to ottawa
is it for me ð
i love you very much sara but for your future i think this internship is more important just focus on what you have to do for now
yeh
so when will you graduate
summer next year that is actually not very far i hope you can stay in canada after graduating a lot of people have trouble staying because they cant find a job
i hope everything work out for you
oh ok
you gotta try and do your best thats the only thing you can do now
i will do my best to support you too finding jobs and stuffs resume review
sorry i am just talking to the person who is hiring a unity developer
i will the person is actually somebody i know
elad raphael he participated in the 2min entreprenuerial speech competition just like me i think he came in 2nd place
oh it is in uottawa it was last year september
the same thing as what we worked on in gng4120
but the game was totally different back then it wasnt a firstperson simulation it was a tower defense game with the theme of cell biology
haha ya but it was also very immature if you think about it
haha ya that is true
eventually but yes i hope so
ok
ya enjoy as much as you can anyways good night sara love you
chill out is correct
hang out is almost the same
love you too night you sent a photo hey sara check this out
as lovely as you are sara
have fun at work here is kaylatxt hey talk on here i cant connect to wechat now for some reason
yo i am at the train station i should have stayed and helped you clean up
ya
the only regret i have is not making you orgasm goddamn
i didnt friggin know it takes that long for girls to orgasm
how long does it take
wtf you never had an orgasm what
that is madness do you have like vaginal disorder or something
well i will try to be that boyfriend but i dont want sex to be a major component of our relationship
how do you feel that
i just want to know about your situation so i can priortize other things in our relationship if sex is too difficult for us then we will do other stuffs you dig
alright sara
you understand
it is a slang
i love you so much
i want to ask your permission to let me play soma without you i cant focus when i play with you
where did you learn how to say bro lol
so do i have your permission master hello you sent 3 photos
ya thats the thingunfortunately
no worries i am boarding train now
air conditioning is good here
lol i dont need them small socks i dont like them
haha you look like a ghost sorry i just woke up from a small nap i miss the 7up from your fridge
the way your face twists when you press your face against the bed
you look normal when i am in bed with you but without that context
oh i didnt even notixe
well without that context the image you sent me looks like a ghost
but dont worry you look beautiful when you dont do that lol especially when we went out today
i absolutely loved cuddling with you
thats the one thing i am gonna miss in toronto but you didnt orgasm next time i want to do better
lol why what was that about
how did you come to have such fearful feelings about sex i find it unusual
you should try masturbating maybe try to reach orgasm on your own
i will try then because i love you very much
it sort of is but regardless you shouldnt feel gross about reaching pleasure with your own body
then sleep
ya
now we are in the same country we can talk more later sara love you
i am back now good night
i got slightly sick again not sure why
ya not sure if i should go to work today i havent left yet
i dont think sandal is an issue it is mostly an upperbody problem but after i left the station it was chilly outside this might just be a light cold
no i absolutely refuse to keep it warm
i will wear sandals if i want lol i think i will actually go to work i just talked to my father and he motivated me to not be a pussy
haha ok well i will prepare to go then
hey can you look around your house to see what kind of parkings are available train fares are too damn expensive now
so the guest of the tenants can park there
ok i will probably drive up there then
that looks delicious did you add some of the leftover from the hotpot
nice what kind of dish is it
i know how to make it too what sauce are you gonna use lao gan ma
hope it tastes good for you
it was nice i was surprisingly productive today
how was your day
did you take care of the housing contract oh that is great news sara
ya
i will first send him the information before i send the deposit
ok i will wait for him to reply back before i send my deposit so probably tomorrow
haha that is fast
well i told him yesterday i will send him everything by tonight and he said it is ok so hopefully he keeps his promise
in my pocket
he doesnt sign it the deposit is the legal contract
so when do you get to choose your courses for your new program
when did they say you will likely get in
damn girl well i hope it is soon the classes fill up fast
hey did you send the information to alain yet
i already sent mine hopefully he replies soon
hey do you want to play dome dota2 some
ok
he hasnt replied
he might reply back tomorrow
where are you at right now
nice are you having a fun time
chinese or american
tell them that you are sleepy
anyways i just want to tell you i will come visit you in two weeks with my car
unless you dont want me around anymore
i am joking
we can go hiking next time
isnt gatineau the national park
i think gatineau first which one
alright then gatineau first
have enjoy the remainder of your evening i will play a bit of dota and then go to sleep
i love you sara
good night
yo can you give me alains number or can you contact him sometime today if he doesnt reply back to our messages by the morning by 12pm i mean
ok then we will wait
we will wait
i told him i will send him the information first and he said it is alright
ya ok i think we will probably get the rooms we just wait a bit
when did you call him
last night
lol 830 might be too early call him at noon
ya sure
alainsuzeauhotmailcom sorry i am a bit busy right now let me know how things go with him
i already did
does he absolutely need it
did you give him your drivers permit
you dont even have it do you not so why does he need it from me
ok i will talk to him in a few minutes right now i am busy
hey tell me alains number
thanks hey have you sent him any information yet hey sara dont send alain anymore information i believe he is a scammer
dont send him anything anymore he is asking for my social insurance numbrt
that is not right
forget about the passport
he cant do anything with those
or maybe he can but you should contact the canadian agency to confirm with them whether that is dangerous
he was too nice i got a bad vibe this whole time and when he asked me for the social insurance number i knew that he cant be trusted
make some phone calls with the passport people to make sure that you are safe
what information did you tell him your passport number
i am not going to give him my social insurance number
no i have not but look you know what i will make the phone call and i will tell him that i am not comfortable giving my information i do not need to give him any information
he doesnt need my ssn he said he needs the deposit but now i am scared that he is trying to scam 400 from me
but they are your employer
they need to pay you money what information have you sent him so far
did you send him your ssn
yes
yo we will talk about this tonight
i got to work
do not deal with him for now
this deal is very abnormal is it ok for me to challenge him like ask him he is a scammer we might lose the house
but it is safer this way
he wants my identity he told me i need your identity and that is very abnormal in all the places that i have rented in the past i never had a single place asking me for these information
so is it ok for me to challenge him we might lose the house but it is safer
do you mind calling the school to see if this is a legitimate person httpsweb5uottawacarezwebsearchphpid37121
please do i will talk to you tonight i am gonna go back to work hey i think it is probably a safe place to live at
i talked to my colleagues
they think that he probably was once had a problem tenant
still confirm
but i think he is probably safe he seemed very knowledeable about the area and if he is a scammer then he would not reveal himself
you cant call them
oh ok
ok you know what forget about it i dont want you to spend too much time on this it could end up being a waste of time actually it is probably completely safe httpscalinkedincominalainsuzeaua520b246 this person is legitimate
which email
but i will give him the deposit tonight
ok
alright hopefully he gives you the receipt lol
sorry about dat he never should have asked for my social insurance number that raised the alarm for me
no he doesnt need it i just gave him my home address and he was satisfied with that
because i think he just wants some way to track me down if i do something bad so home address is good enough but he preferably wants everything which is still not very wise
i didnt give him anything other than my home address
well if he doesnt give you receipt then i will know to not trust him lol and if that does happen i will split the lost cost with you and report him to police have you received your receipt
what
lol
well aint that sweet of you i have been masturbating to you for the past two days thats my replacement for making love you can try the same thing
give you a name
orgasmlikestone lol
chihaya
i dont know what this name means it just sounds cutr what the hell kind of game is this
lol what ff14 doesnt look like that i dont know
is that right tell me how fun it is later
ok did i ruin your day with me freaking out about the scam
i am so sorry sara i believe he is a legitimate person you got nothing to worry aboit did you do anything else for the day
what happened
what the other guys problem broke up
who cares about graduation
right i am gonna do some push ups better believe i will last longer the next time we make love
hey i dont mean no disrespect but can you stop saying man and bro i dont like them being used by girls it makes it sounds like i am talking to a man
is that alright with you
no problem sara i still love you
i just did twenty push ups it was easier than i expected and jerk off means masturbate which means playing with yourself to orgasm
which is different from me having an orgasm from having sex with you last time i came too early
i dont know but i can cum 3 times a day at least
lol you sure love it
how can you tell did you feel it when i was fingering you
i should have kept going but you started crying very sadly
i didnt want to see you like that
it made me sad
lol did they complain about your moaning
alright so we arent going to make love anymore in your place
the only thing that needs inhibiting is your moaning sara but i love hearing you moan
i am gonna go take care of some house keeping i will talk to you in a bit
not necessarily actually yes most formal contracts have two signatures
if you still feel unsafe you should ask to meet him i have been at places where they dont even do receipts how do things work with jag
if you feel unsafe i recommend you go speak to him about it
first name and signature
i think it is decent
i already sent him
ya he accepted
i havent checked yet he accepted the money like 10 minutes ago
how did you sign your lease with jag before you came to canada
maybe you can send him another email telling him to do the exact same thing explain to him respectfully that despite the receipt you can only trust him when he signed on the receipt with his own name
i am asking whether you are going to send him an email asking for a more formal receipt
lol yes he is
really
yo calm down for a second maybe we should forget about this and just take care of this tomorrow i dont know what he is up to he might be busy
alain suzeau i already saved his image on my computer if he is indeed a scammer then we can report him to the police using this image you can also go look for him at his work place
how did you ask him
you just need him to sign the lease with alain suzeau
ya sure go ahead but for now just wait for his response to your email
i still think it is decent it is just a matter of trust i am just saying dont ask for the money back until we figure out what we want to do
i can trust that guy but you should still get in touch with him about the signature anyways i am going to sleep now good night to you
just go to sleep and think about it tomorrow you can think more clearly then and relax with some games
seems like you are having fun thats good anyways i will chat with you tomorrow good night love you
whats the problem
hey look do you think you might be overreacting you got his signature i talked to my friend yesterday and my friend thought that caro is his wifes name and today alain confirmed that caro is his wife
i didnt feel it was significant
sorry i dont understand what you are upset about you wanted me to tell you something
so he doesnt need anything from me anymore i didnt give him any of my ids except of my home address and i thought i told you that already
i think he is legit because we visited his house saw him in person and he already gave us his receipt i came down to this conclusion this morning
ya
i dont think there is any problem in that last email did you tell him that you felt unsafe about the house because of the stuffs that happened
ok if you still do feel unsafe i think it is reasonable to ask him to provide some kind of id to you
but you have to mention about your feeling of unsafeness in your email if you want him to provide something
haha yes i do do you want me to talk to him about it i can do the talking you seem really stressed
i will see if i can contact him tonight
in person
i will call him by phone
yes i will do that tonight or tomorrow hey i gotta get back to work
if you have anything more to say say it now ok i will talk to you later then hey what information do you want from him
so you dont need me to ask him anymore
i personally think it is rude to ask him if he is indeed a legit person he might dislike us
ok to be honest we probably wouldnt even care at that point i might still call him tonight to clarify certain things but i wont necessarily ask him for anything
hey i decided i am not going to contact him because i am firmly confident that he is a legitimate man there is nothing to gain from talking to him about our paranoia
how was your day had fun i am starving like wolf now i can probably eat that whole hot pot you made last time
you made what were you experimenting
lol but you learn a lot from experimentation cant make perfect dishes until you take the steps to perfect it which involves failure
whats up bored
i miss you too wanna kiss you
what is that
what were you doing for the whole day i was just about to do some work on blender
but i can chat with you instead
were you cleaning up the kitchen or just experimenting with cooking
you are so dedicates dedicated
i am gonna book my train ticket that is coming up in 3 weeks they are refunding a lot of the costs because of the huge delays

fortunately i got off early so i didnt experience the delay but i am still getting refunds lol
i am driving to your house next week then two weeks later i will go by train

you can probably cook as well as the chefs in the restaurants
i would be happy with you if you can make anything even resembling those high class dishes lol anyways i wont bother you anymore i am gonna clean up and take care of my stuffs have fun cooking
just came back from biking how is your potato
honye whats up how was your experimentation
tried what new things
why are you apologizing
ok it doesnt matter to me whether you can fry stuffs or not
but you dont know how to fry
it is ok if you dont know how to fry it
because i am not asking you to fry anything i am not demanding anything from you does that make sense
but i am happy that you are trying to do so much for me were you learning to cook for me
right hongye i think it is great that you are learning to cook for yourself
hey thats no problem but if you ever wanna eat some home cooking i can share some with you so what are you gonna do now sleep

almost like a family huh are you a waitress
my goodness i want to see how you serve people do you wear a cute uniform i bet you look cute in your waitress outfit i am gonna go to swimming pool will chat with you later
sara you are one crazy girl i dont know if i would be turned on seeing your naked body while serving people
but you would certainly catch my attention if you dress beautifully
i dont think i will feel anything because i have seen enough porn to be immune to seeing naked girls
lol i wouldnt like that one bit because you are worth a lot so your body aint cheap you get what i mean i will be more worried about your own wellbeing than being mad at you
yes you are lol lets just say i will be a little bit upset a little bit
welcome back a long day for you
that is so long 11 hours how do you like your work place
you are so incredibly productive
it has only been a week and you already found a place to work thats nice seeing you work hard might make me motivates motivated
dont worry about it
i was thinking about uninstalling actually
do you work again tomorrow
oh man are you going to be alright next weekend
you dont have to force yourself if you cant if you cant shift your schedule let me know i am very flexible so the internet is not very good today i am gonna go to sleep for today
love you too hongye you worked hard today i am proud of you
i dont know lol i am not sleepy anymore after brushing my teeth
why interview videos
do you think the videos will help i feel that the only thing you need in an interview is knowledge and confidence understanding what you are capable of doing is the most important does that make sense
right
ya that makes sense i dont believe in watching videos to learn how to do interview at least for me but it may work for other people
yes it may come to me more naturally then please go ahead i wont stop you
good about what
i dont feel anything i am lucky that it comes to me naturally
all i was saying was that i dont prepare for interviews because i am confident in what i am capable of doing which makes the interview process easy
ya sorry i think i came off as trying to persuade you but i didnt understand your situation very well anyways i am gonna go to sleep chat with you later xoxo
good night hongye morning sunshine when are you working today
ok my father is showing me documents of his car
yup
in case i need to use them
i am back i learned everything i can about the car next week we can have make love in the morning
i never learnt it but its gotta be the same as doing it on bed and my father never made love in car but you know what we can do and make love in the car in the morning
you know i am
we can have the window slightly open
it is not comfortable lol we shouldnt do it but the car will always be there for love making if you need it
damn i miss kissing with you i absolutely love it
have you tried masturbating after i left
lol do i have to do it for you do i have to be the one to learn all the female genital biology and make you orgasm i would gladly do it dont get me wrong
i will do some research this morning
pretty good playing dota2 and winning
how is yours
how so less customers
lol oh so now you know how to make sushi now
did you say you worked in a sushi restaurant before
oh i see
ok girl are you on break now
i see how was lunch sushi lol
oh thats not so bad
i am thinking about uninstalling dota2 do you think i should
you think i should
i dont want to play the game actually
and it is a huge waste of time 3 hours
ya alright
i dont have anything particularly urgent now but i feel bad playing the game every time you are chatting with me lol
because you are more important than the game thats obvious ð
but it also makes me feel bad to abandon and lose focus in a serious game
ya you didnt but it made me lose focus for the entire duration of the game lol i am not blaming you
please this is not your fault
i dont want to play the game if it means i lose time chatting with you
you know what that could work too are you on break now
ok
tell me when you are off
right now ok
go getem love you too hongye oh ya i want to tell you something in case i forget hey are you off work now
i bet you are tired
to drink alcohol
well you if you like that then we can go i didnt realize you actually like that because you said you dont drink much alcohol
haha i see
we should take walks more often then but we can honestly take walk once while i am there only once
hey when school starts do you want to walk to school everyday instead of taking bus
walking for like 40 min everyday will surely be good for your health
it is up to you
oh you are gonna be working part time during school period
ok how many days are you working a week
you sure work hard so that is like 4 days a week during summer
and two days during school perios there are pros and cons to working during school time the pros is that you can earn lots of money
ok
well you will probably work the first few weeks of school
once you feel the work becoming overwhelming you can quit
ya how do your colleagues like you surely they must think you are an incredibly diligent lady
you mean more than 40 hours
so you want to get to 40 hours
if it is loose scheduling you have an issue with why dont you spend time studying stuffs related to your industry like architecture or programming cuz i think they need those skills in civil right
oh i see
that sounds like a plan
ya probably not
ya it is good what you are doing you are quite productive
alarm
what do you mean by alert
ahh i see what you are saying
nobody wants to work like that which is why we want to become professionals at least part of the reason
ok
oh ok thats cool no problem you are tired afterall you can go to sleep without replying back to this message so good night
i will look into it next werk love you too hongye good morning
yo whats up how was your sleep ive been waiting for you all morning
whats wrong
are you just dizzy from waking up
well you get the whole day off today i wanted to tell you that yesterday i was listening to a horror story podcast and it was very good
do you know what a podcast is
the podcast name is called unexplained
if you dont want to watch horror movies because they are too scary you should listen to this lol
these ones are really good what do you plan on doing today
well arent you the diligent one
but you arent even gonna relax you know what i can understand you i would be bored too if i am just relaxing all day yesterday i got so bored i decided to read some materials for my work
use some bengay
you worked very hard i applaud you
not in your room
oh why
lol thats why dealing with pets is tough
but he is cute anyways i dont blame you for wanting him
then why did you get it
ya that was a dumb choice and then he didnt want it anymore
oh ok can you return the hamster to a local pet store
lol you want to
ok we can try it then
you should make some phone calls to see if any stores accept pets specifically hamster
oh ok check their hours and make sure we can return it when we go
and give them a phone call too hey what exactly is our plan for next week
how far is gatineau park from your place
alright thats not bad we gotta prepare some portable food for that day
sandwich is probably the best
i can help you prepare during the morning
i can but what are you gonna use it for and how big do you want them to be
you have pretty big bowls for noodle dishes you cant use those
ok so you want even bigger ones
i only have one that is slightly bigger than those
ya i am not sure how big you want them to be so it is better if you get it yourself
but since i am coming over by car i can bring over some tools that you need if you need anything let me know first
ok ð lol that was unintentional do you need a better knife ð
ok you having fun with your listening exercises
i am working on blender
wait a second i am modelling a cutting board and a knife i will show you after i finish
i think i need to use your computer for rendering lol my laptop is very slow when it comes to rendering
it can but it is very slow because my graphics card is not very good
ya at least something good i am almost done rendering here it is you sent a photo
is that what it is
ya the proportion seems a little small
it is amd radeon pro 555 it is one of the worst ones in the market lol
my macbook was 3000 i didnt get the laptop for rendering i got it so i can play indie games
i suppose an added benefit of dating you is access to your good desktop lol
it is a joke
lol perhaps that is true if you dont like this level of directness i can stop i am not trying to hurt your feeling i meant i dont want to hurt your feeling
sorry are you upset that i said that
it is hard to tell jokes on im
i cant take it easy
but you can help me relax
relax irl i mean i cant tell whether you are upset or you dont care on im
in real life
on im
ya that will solve the problem
where are you going
haha ok you are intense just the way i like it
i love you talk to you later
whats up you done studying
who the hell is a shahroodi
i dont know who that is
shahroodi is the last name i believe
who is this joker
what kind of lessons
i see what does he want from you
just like one of those information emails sent to many people
go ahead i encourage you
no worries i am sure shahroodi is the last name this is my latest render you sent a photo
you are getting better at being a wife everyday is that potato in the dish
how does it taste
that could work but i think potato should take the flavor of the dish instead of having its own taste
i mean if your dish doesnt have much flavor then the potato wont have much either or maybe add some kind of liquid or gravy like substance
but it looks good though haha sausage huh sausage is not that salty
if you want salt you should get bacon
well i have been cooking for a while so ya ð
go ahead you are gonna have to work hard towards that goal the thing is potato by itself tastes good because of its texture
you can try many different kinds of sauces the one that i use the most often specifically for potato are curry and nikujaga sauce nikujaga sauce is the one i used last time i came to your house
if you dont want to use sauces you should just add salt i think adding salt is still good but i personally prefer the potato take the flavor from sauces
i think you and i will get along just fine just fine
we agree in a lot of things
you mean why not aim for excellence
ya i dont know why not people should always aim for excellence and perfection i dont like mediocrity
which sentence
you are asking why not aim for excellence
i respond by ya i dont know why you wouldnt aim for excellence which means i agree with you
well i am always aiming for excellence you dont need to push me
because i am tianren i gotta aim for heaven thats who i am
the overall meaning of what i just said is that i agree with you 100 and i also aim for excellence for perfection in the things that i do thats all you need to know
i think you were confused about people should aim for excellence
just fine has a very strong meaning fine itself is very passive in some context and i think you were referring to those passive use of fine but if you want me to not use fine i can stop
hey just understand when i said we will get along just fine i meant i really love the way you and i think alike in many crucial ideologies
i think you will find other people use that phrase often i guess i wont change then if i have your permissionð
haha ok so my master agrees with me
it is cleaning itself
ya small animals like hamster have the same effect on me do you still want to send him back to pet store
make your decision by the time i visit you
i got two cats right now and they bother my sleep a lot but i feel bad sending them away
it is a tough decision
nah i dont want to deal with pets
if you raise them for long enough you dont want to send them away but at the same time they are gonna be a bother to your work and make you lose focus
i believe so too because you are focused on your work you should send him to somebody who can show more love
i think the pet store is not a bad place
the people from pet stores typically treat the pets very kindly
what were you doing for the whole day by the way
but damn you gonna go see aurora borealis that would be sick
means amazing
do you even have enough time to go
oh wait i guess you dont have work tomorrow
then i guess it is fine even if you do have work it starts late is he your white friend who invited you to his family dinners
ok
ya i am sure he is you should go have some fun
dont worry about it you dont need to ask my permission to have fun but aurora borealis is something i wish i could go see myself
thats why i think you should go see it because it is probably beautiful
i am gonna go back to my game world you go have fun with your friends talk to you later sweet heart
thats too bad i am having fun here playing my game
have fun then i am going to sleep now good night love you
how was your outing last night
well that sucks for you
were you the only one who went i meant were there other people other than marc
oh i thought there might be other people around
i see
whats the matter with him
lol well i appreciate your concern ya i was a little worried when i woke up today but i trusted you and nothing happened
well not in that sense i wasnt talking about cheating or anything
i think you can maintain friendship with him but dont go out in the middle of the night alone with people
finding a wife he doesnt have a wife
ok well if he wants to find someone then i am sure he will find someone eventually i dont think you need to worry about him being single at age 40 is a choice choice he made consciously
you mean us going to dinner and stuff
ya i got no problem with that
ð i will show you lotsa love this weekend
really late around 12
this is my first time driving alone in the middle of the night for a long distance so i gotta be alert on the road
i am worried about myself too lol well if anything i will be the one hitting other cars so i wont die from this lol
i dont need to practice i drive every week
i drove from toronto to ottawa before just never in the dark
i am gonna get back to work
have fun
lol what are you doing
is he your strongest pokemon he better be
oh ok guess i will be your favorite pokemon then what is its type
it is a fire type pokemon that will eventually gain psychic abilities
i love fire type
when i used to play pokemon i always chose fire
playing the intense horror game it is an awesome game how was your day
you were playing pokemon
lol ya but at least i am not playing dota2
what are you cooking
with the hot pot materials
you sent a photo
this is my best photo of him
tommy
wow my father ate like that when he was a student
he ate like a cave man
do you look like a cave man too when you eat it
it is rare to see cave woman nowadays cuz most of them dont show their inner primitiveness i wish i could take a picture of you eating from the pot
dont worry about it i will have plenty of chance when we start living together
next time lets take a selfie of me licking your face that would look crazy
yo did you send your parents the photo of me licking your boob lol
httpwwwentravitycomwpcontentuploads201212sao247sugoulickingtearsjpg i was suggesting something like this
lol
i was joking
i can do anything
i dont know any crazy stuffs i can do
making love is normal
it aint crazy but there are crazy ways of making love
would you say that your behaviour do not match your conservativeness
i dont know whether i like it or not i dont know how i should feel about it ð i should appreciate that girlfriend has such voluptuous tits my
hey my parents were talking about inviting you over for a few days but i think you will be busy with your part time job
they werent joking
i know we talked about this before
but they just recently started talking about it again since i went to visit you now that i think about it i still think it might be safer if we just keep to ourselves
i am very happy my parents are taking about this but i gotta keep calm and make the best decision
possibly christmas if you are not going back to china
you are gonna be lonely in ottawa i think i will invite you over for christmas if i dont invite you over i would be considered a failure as a boyfriend
especially since your family is not here
no i did not i could have told them but i decided not to
but i told them before i went to your house that we were going to fuck all day
they thought i was joking
well i said that as a joke and they took it as a joke but in reality we did make love just not all day but if we wanted to we could have played around all day
i heard there is no limit to the number of times a girl can orgasm in a single day
so i could play with you all day
have you like never tried to masturbate at all
or you were just unsuccesful
you can orgasm by rubbing your clitoris you dont need penetration
yes
you are so pure yet so tainted by me i will see what i can this friday night can do
lemme show you something interesting i brought from japan
you sent a photo those are sex stickers
they are more like souvenir collections i am not brave enough to actually use them lol
do you like those positions
i showed them to you because those are my favorite positions
in hentai of course
the one on the most right
there needs to be a wall for me to ping you against but your room doesnt have one
i think it will be easier for me too
lol i have seen movies where if you make love against a door it could make noises
haha screw those guys listening they can listen all they want
it could echo into the hallway
we can still try it
all this sex talk has gotten me aroused lol i wish i could make love with you now
is there anything you like to talk about other than sex i dont know whether talking about sex all day in a relationship is normal
what are those things
oh right i was thinking about wearing my normal clothes but wear shorts we gotta bring some snacks with us while hiking and water of course our lunch
two bottles per person
are there any at the park
we can drink a lot before we start hiking how long do you expect the  hike to last
hopefully i am not dead at the end of it
i think i did 1 hour befor but not two hours are we going uphill or just a flat plain
there was one time when i was climbing like 200 meter hill and it was absolutely crazy 200 meter height mind you it will be fun when i hike with you
hahaha that too i wont forget
please lose some weight in the next 3 days if you can
you know what you are right i guess i wont be off easy with you
exactly 50
ok so apparently you are considered to be underweight so you are heavy indeed because of your height
hey i am gonna go to sleep now
lets chat tomorrow
good night
ok love you sara sweet dreams
ð you changed your profile picture on fb
i thought you finished an hour ago
you told me you work from 510 right
sorry what
right i just wanted to chat with you a little before i go to sleep i dont have anything important to say my father and i cleaned our cars today
ya
oh nice where is that person from or i mean who is this person i am gonna go down to sleep i will talk with you tomorrow good night and love you
sorry thought you went to take care of something and i was really sleepy morning sara are you still sleeping
hey good morning sweet heart sorry i couldnt chat with you last night
the romance book
how do you like it
i see diligent little girl but maybe you could enjoy it
what did you learn so far how to be a great girlfriend
lol
oh the excitement when are you working today
do you get paid extra if you stay later than 10
i just realized it is not really that big of a deal 30 min extra is actually nothing
well you are lucky to have found such a place
lol so that is lucky
lol i think you can be thinner if you eat less food and honesty i can be thinner yoo too i used to be thinner
but then i started eating too much
the photo of me with my friends
i want to be thinner i dont like the bag at my belly
have you seen my belly
i was thin for 23 years of my life but the sudden increase in fat is disturbing for me
i want to lose my abdominal fat mostly i am ok with fat in other parts of my body
ya same here i ran without getting tired for 17 minutes on saturday that felt good
i dont know
i cant tell maybe 2 or 3 kilos
i can hold my iphone and have it record for me while i run
i can strap it onto something i think there is a way
when you sent me that photo i thought you were trying to seduce me lol
well you look great and sexy
i love distractions
i love to be seduced by my girlfriend you should seduce me more often
fuck my work it is not important
haha that was a nice pun
ok are you going to make it look prettier
ð oh hell no that was not intentional ð­ actually that one is inaccurate too forget it
i said forget it
yo i was playing my video game
the horror game it is a long game several hours
but so far i really love it ya i wish we had played this together lol
maybe i really should stop playing for now
we could
is it at the back of the house
alright if it is free then i will park on the road
i will ask my father what this means
i think it means you can park all day on weekends since you can park 1 hour on weekdays
ok we will figure it out when i get there how was your day today you were seducing me at 4 and then you left
what were you doing
what do you mean by step out
oh ok so what did you find out whats the process like for somebody like you
i am just curious but you dont have to explain it if it is too much trivial facts
i bet you have to write a bunch of tests
right
i see you need to be evaluated first
i sent them an email before about becoming peo without a degree in engineering so i have some familiarity
but your description seems like you need an evaluation
i just asked them what do i have to do to become a professional engineer if i dont go through the undergrad degree that sounds like a pain
what is smp
what is eit engineer in training
i see well you will eventually find a way to become a professional in canada it is just a matter of time as long as you find a nice job that you can work on here
i feel like you cant do that if you are working
of course
thanks you are a wonderful girl
yes you are i absolutely love you for that
i am going to sleep
well good luck
good night
love you sara morning sunshine i guess you are at work today all day
lol what was the conversation like
i bet i was telling you how to use blender
just a random guess
i remember i thought about you the most right when we first started dating but nowadays i have calmed down significantly
ya i lost a lot of sleep from that lol
ya i was surprised i thought i would have a massive boner all night if i slept next to you
we slept like two rocks that day
sara wherefore art thou
how was your day had fun at work i presume ð
good for you for working hard my hands are hurting these days for some reason i dont know why maybe it is getting too hot and i am getting tendonitis
i dont know it is just slightly hurting not significant but i can feel it i will be coming for you tomorrow sweet heart do you need anything i will bring a little snack over
you will get it for sure i am not buying any flavor condoms because i dont like my dick being sucked
i just find it disparaging whoever is doing it
i want to treat you with respect and i feel sucking dick is going too far lol
you are welcome lol we are talking seriously about sucking dick here on fb that is kind of funny
if i say suck my dick
lol
sorry that was too funny ok then lets be open with our feelings when we meet i will try my best
i am gonna go to sleep now tomorrow will be a long day and i want to get more sleep than usual
see you tomorrow hongye i love you
hey tonight when i get there i am gonna need your help locating that parking loy
i might be there early maybe 10
i can arrive between 9  11 depending on the traffic yo my building just held a fire drill and i climbed down 14 floors of stairs it felt like a good hiking exercise

ya hey one last thing if you can stay over the weekend or at least until saturday would you stay around i am asking this in terms of your work schedule
ok just verifying
i am not sure yet i need to talk to my parents i will let you know sometime tonight hey whats up sweet heart my parents are happy to have you over the decision is yours
good choice i get the same feeling so we will keep it as that then whats up sweet heart
nothing important i wanted to ask you whether you are ok with me working on the friday that are here in toronto that you are here
sorry but i can let you in my building there is wifi here and you can do whatever
aint a problem the thing is you kind of have to come with me if we are to have a date
i am talking about friday
do you like aquarium thats where i am planning right now
i think i will book your train back to ottawa on sunday morning
actually
it is up to you how you want to come here
do you still want me to book a train ticket if i use the refunded money it will cost significantly less
it will cost less than 1 10
yes it is not exactly deposit
they refunded my two tickets that costed 90
lol so you tell me do you want me to book the tickets or what better to do it early than later but take your time deciding
ok
the train can work at that time there is one at 10am
hey so do you still want to wait for two weeks to get your own transportation or do you want me to book it for you early
ok are you working now
i am working now too but i am dead tired
so apparently i cant use the refund to buy you tickets what should we do you can try using greyhound that is cheaper than viarail
yes i sleep early nowadays because i get tired refund cannot be used to buy tickets for another person it is ok for self
ok
ya you take care of it but just to let you know the greyhound station in downtown toronto is right next to my work place so it is incredibly easy to pick you up if you choose greyhound
i am not sure what it is called but it is next to bay street
walk 1 min from work place
let me know which one
ya so just let me know when you figure it out
and yo i gotta go to work now talk with you later ð
hey are you working almost feels like you are back in china again
whats going on with you
may i go to sleep early today
you probably have lost a few pounds
doesnt matter to me that much actually you are fine the way you are but losing weight from work is always nice
i went to sleep sweet heart let me know when you are awake
what is going on with you sweet heart havent chatted with you properly in like 3 days
are you tired of me now because i cant push my dick as fast as your ex
lol ok tired from work
i got a lot of work piled on top of me but i feel fine i am excited to go to the aquarium with you havent been to one in ages
right there are good reviews for it
lol when was that
i think there was a movie on that many years ago but nobody is gonna die on our date hey when are you working today
ok i can keep you company online
you are welcome my dear
no i wont
i would if i had my laptop charger lol
your room is so tangled with wires that i couldnt tell i left my charger there
that was not intentional
i wasnt saying that seriously but i think once we move to the new house it will be better because there will be more space
yo whats up i am bored as hell now
what kind of chores cleaning up your room
what files are you referring you to
so the documents are related to eit
oh wow ok by the way aside from the restricted time on wednesday you are free to leave any time on sunday and i will try to send you off too
wow so this guy can speak chinese
maybe you mentioned this before but when can you start being an eit after you graduate
but eit involves internship right
sorry when i hear it i think about in training and that reminds me of doing internships you are gonna be reading lots of books lol
you mean you already know a lot of stuffs
are you going to become an engineer before me
i mean when are you going to start accumulating work experience
well i dont want them to kick your ass back to china thats all
ya you did but if you cant support yourself financially that is the same as not being able to stay in canada
haha you are right about that
i also want to see you in your professional sexy dress once you get a professional job that would be nice
nope i havent have you
i will chat with her tonight now that you reminded me
who knows where she will go to euphemistic like i cant say goddamn
oh ok right encouraging her and stuff be nice in general
lol you remind me of my old self
lol how did they do that i am curious now
i see kay was a very sociable person i think she will be alright
as long as there are jobs in her market
she was more sociable than you when we first met
at least she was more comfortable with english so that helped her express herself better
for sure
thanks for entertaining me love you
yo what is going on
nice i am still awake
it is at the boring part
reporting my own findings and documenting my progrrss
it is hard to explain but basically i confirmed my bosss theory
but it is hard to think of anything new to do with this project did you talk with kay today she told me to play mahjong together with her
i would be down to play mahjong by the way do you know how to play it
we then need a fourth person
you mean you mostly play digitally
which site do you go to play mahjong
ok well we can go visit her anytime
what are you buying pills
well go get it i came up with the idea for my next game dev project
it is a walking simulator that takes place in an apartment unit i havent decided on the content yet
house party
but yo there is an actual game called house party on steam and it is a sex comedy
taking place in an apartment
15
lol the slaughter is an interesting game
that is not a big deal i have wasted way more time playing games compared to you
what cyber game
oh ok so you are gonna get good at it
go ahead play it until you get bored
how is it a female friendly game lots of female play it
i guess girls love that kind of game
you cannot talk to me later because i am gonna sleep now i will fall asleep while masturbating to you
good night
love you whats up hongye i am bored to hell again
i bet you are having fun not yet i wanna eat with my colleagues but they usually dont eat until later
how was it you need to tell me how you think about it
one of the points the movie was making was that these peoples lives were led by worldly desires and materials and as a result their lives are filled with violence and lacks meaning dark humor
lol i dont think it is an anti racism movie why did you think that
hmm ok
i know
if you want to watch a real racism movie you should watch django but pulp fiction was certainly not a racism movie in my opinion
can i speak honestly about this
so basically i think if i watched this movie when i was like 18 or 20 i might have thought the same thing that this movie was about racism
the idea of living a less materialistic life
no problem i will talk to you later
where are you going
sorry i dont know what that is
didnt know they had this campus
are you taking care of your engineering documents
oh you are gonna need it in the new house but we wont get to use it during winter
snow
not all the time if there is even a small amount of snow it could mess with biking
yes
i think so people are gonna look at you weird you are considering a kid bike what kind of bike is it can you show me
maybe the size doesnt matter as long as it fits you
i dont know how big that is
dont you find it awkward physically riding a small bike
i see it is still up to you you know what as long as you are comfortable with it dont worry about what other people thinks
you wont fall into river no matter what you do lol
lol jesus sounds like something is gonna go wrong i feel so damn bored
nah i wont
i dont want you to learn my bad habits
yo do you wanna come over to my house next week
if you cant i will visit you
girls shouldnt say wtf
you know what forget it i will come over to you i asked because my friend wanted to meet you but he can wait
what is so excellent about it
when are you gonna reach here
you know monday is a day off i dont have work on monday hey look you sure about this
alright then i will talk to my parents about this
probably if you come
ya i dont care what happens afterward either i am too scared of my parents but i gotta man up
i will let you know by tonight
check pgcrl that is my work place hey the verdict is in i will be coming to your house next week you dont need to plan anything but i will be leaving on sunday
whatchu doing now sweet heart

holy shieeeet that looks incredible
i didnt know you can do this no i went out for a walk with my dear father
you are becoming a better waifu you should have some veggies to go with your food
wife
your future husbands wife it could be me it could be some other men who knows
oh right that is a problem i used to buy vegetable packs but they would go bad before i finish them so i stopped buying them
i started buying cucumbers because they dont go bad as fast i will go back to toronto to meet my dear friend we are gonna play mahjong
ya it is gonna be fun magjong is really fun when i play with him next week we will watch some dota on saturday what do you want to do on sunday

ya but if we got plans then i wont watch them
i havent thought of anything what should we do we can do something around the city is the skating rink open on saturday
yes
if you want we could make love all day then i would break my promise
ya
ya thats what i thought too but i am looking into interesting places we can go to in ottawa
we can probably walk around the entire town and find interesting places that is probably better than having a concrete plan
some well dressed bums
who is vincent and what is pis
lol
lol that guys actual name is jules he called himself pit because he didnt want to tell bret his real name
ya that was very confusing when i first saw it
but it also made the scene kind of funny ya
the story is not chronological they are presented out of order so you have to piece it together yourself
ya what is your problem
the last segment of the film where you saw vincent alive happened before butch killed vincent that is why i said the film is not presented in order
i know what you are talking about
and i dont think you undersatnd what i am saying but it is ok yo i am gonna brush my teeth and go to sleep is that cool with you
awesome
then chat later
i love you very much sara good night
i think it is fine i dont see any problems with it was this what you were talking about before and can you send me message to my cellphone instead of facebook i am using data now
hey
ð i got free time today not sure what i should do
what are you usually doing off work
not on weekends
lol are you still trying to be a good cook
what did you learn to cook this time
lol i could teach you that myself you dont need to learn from watching videos
you havent learnt nothing until you do it yourself
well anyways
oh what kind of book
oh right how is the book entertained
so it was mostly for learning then learning english i mean
tell me how you think about the book dont be shy
its ok
a pageturner you just keep reading unhindered by the language barrier
do you think you would read this book if you can speak english at native level
haha ok
you are diligent i hope your english improves quickly so you can enjoy english literature more but learning english for practical purposes is certainly important for now i will brb i am back
just had to put some bed sheets to dry i am gonna work now chat with me when you want
love you too i am taking a break from work
did you draw that
kind of
lack of sleep hello hey dont leave me hanging like that
i didnt know what you meant by eye shadow but i know what you are talking about now
you look absolutely beautiful in that where do you come up with such idea
but that doesnt even have black
ya
your original photo had black eyeshadow did it not
lol i cant tell
sorry i dont know what is going on anymore forget it
are you gonna get that bike
maybe you can get one that has two sears seats we can ride together ð
only if you still want me around
hahahaha load me as in i sit at the back
can i hold on to your tits while i ride
it doesnt matter
and i was also joking when i said that
you can buy whatever dota2 tournament starts next week wednesday cant wait i might watch some games on friday night while you sleep is that ok with you dear
oooooh sweeeeeet yo check this out you sent a photo
how is your bike did you get ones with two seats
like the ones where you can sit at the back why dont you show me a picture of the bike
we will see if both of us can ride this lol i think it is perfect for one person though
i dont have any hopes for it but it would be nice if we can both ride lol
it is actually kind of hard to ride with two people
lol it would be good exercise for me
i dont even recognize the hallway is nobody gonna steal it
well thats good i think the back is too low for anybody to ride it i guess you will be the only one to use it
hey sorry i didnt get your message was watching youtube video how was work
a crowded restaurant is nothing to laugh at you basically move all the time was it like that for you
well all i can say is good work i dont know what else to say to you you must be exhausted
i think i would be totally exhausted if i was you lol good for you
you think i am looking down on it
ok
alright i did a bit of work for my lab today
but on a weekend you typically end up relaxing most of the time ya i guess i wont lol
but i wont feel guilty regardless because i already spend extra time off work doing work related stuff oh why
are you working next weekend
right are you gonna study for g1
you will find that it doesnt actually take long to study 2 days max
when are you gonna take the test
i see what else are you gonna do writing the test is just 30 min
haha nice
yo i learnt a new dish today
rice that tastes like japan specifically miso rice
hahaha do you drink any of it
oh shieeeet
it was just badly kept or you just dont like how miso soup looks
you find that disgusting
i see you might like miso rice then like it better i mean
because you wont see any powder after it is done
ya i will one day try to make it for you hey i am gonna sleep now gotta wake up early for work tomorrow
i am looking forward to seeing you again this weekend
i will chat with you tomorrow good night love you ð
whats up missing me already
lol is that right
so we gonna fuck all day this weekend
what word less frequent sex ya thats no problem
i didnt say those exact words i just said we wont fuck 3 times a day everyday
hahaha we will see i will get us some nice condoms i will bring over a few for this weekend when was your last period
ok that is almost exactly 28 days
i dont know why but after hearing your news i am getting this weird blood rushing feeling in my body possibly relief
haha i dont think it is empathy you think too highly of me i am more selfish than you might think are you resting these days because you were predicting to have your period
i see but it is nice to get a break
but you will still work on friday
oh nice i dont have to wait for you outside then
that could work too since there is likely no traffic there at night time
we will see you can tell me before i get there dear sara i bought the condoms
i mean i think they are good
you sent a photo nothing special other than the fact that i bought like tons of them
yea
who knows what might happen if i switch to a crappier condom
that is the number of condom per box
total price was 32 including tax
yes they are not
crown is made in japan and this is the one you are talking about
ya
i know a lot about this because i think about sex everyday
i wouldnt know anything about that i gotta ask a japanese person for that type of question you want me to ask somebody
i have a few contacts on fb i can ask them
they will think of me differently after i ask them that question how was your day
oh ya
oh what kind of place is it this time
nice you find jobs so quickly did they offer you the job
well thats perfect then huh but you gotta go to work right after school time otherwise you have to commute 1 hour to go to work on weekends
you know what thats right
some kind of special deal for your patronage
so it was a special deal
go crazy yeah hey what kind of movies do you like just out of curiositu
i was thinking maybe we could go watch something either on the internet or in theatre lol are you serious you didnt seem like you were interested
lol ok
do you want to check annabelle ð annabelle creation you are gonna love it
you sure about that ð
hey lemme tell you something my previous pseudogirlfriend absolutely hated horror films and she didnt tell me that she hated it
so i kept asking her to watch it with me you got to tell me if you actually hate it
ok
atta girl well i am not sure if i actually want to see annabelle until it gets some reviews i was just joking
but i havent seen any films lately so i want to watch something new
ya
i believe so
you are not gonna watch them on your own are you
up to you little girl dont soil your pants i am gonna have dinner now
dumpling leftover may i go
i just came back from a walk contemplating about life i miss you too sara
lol
what did you think about
that is a tough question depends on what you want to do what do you want to do
well if you stay in environmental engineering you will definitely graduate in winter
so lets assume that you will graduate during winter what do you want to do afterwards
by the way have you looked into the application for graduation just before we continue this conversation
ok so back to the topic  i will wait for you to finish typing
sounds like you may find a job then
it is because it depends on individuals everybody is different
environmental engineering
then you need to focus on your current career path
and if that is the case then you will most likely graduate in winter
you are gonna find a person to sublet
that is a good idea so you will move to toronto
you will only stay in ottawa if you find a decent job
well that is something you will worry about when it gets closer to your graduation date what is your backup if you cant find your career job
because remote places have more environmental jobs
the moment of truth will be in december i just realized that it is too early to worry about it now
well what are you going to do about what might happen in five months
right
you are most likely going to do well in classes it is the jobs that you gotta worry about
you want me to give the full explanation
there was two main problems with my masters one was that it suffocated my creativity the second was that i was dealing with a very toxic boss and the second problem with the toxicity
sorry me and my boss
ya i got no problem with science well the only problems that i have with science is that i have lost interest in it since i entered the field with the wrong motivation
sorry dear are you asking me whether there was any problem with the content of my work that made me dislike my master
yes there are plenty but at the time i was so sick of biology that i didnt want to go back into the field
the funny thing is if my parents had been more supportive of me and given me the breathing space to rest and encouraged me to pursue my own interest during that time period i might have gone back to medicine or biomedical science
haha ya game design would be great thanks for your encouragement sweet heart
but i also need the people around me to support and encourage me to be successful and i think you do just that
no problem girl but i can stick around and listen to what you have to say it is interesting talking about this
right maintaining friendship is important
laughed at for being serious
a little bit
but you actually did well
right
thats nice at least you got some people you get along with you should just hang out with those people is there a problem with that
if you want you can join me and my friends we all speak english and we dont talk about stuffs like getting high grades it might help you with your english too
well i made decent number of friends but we dont hangout all that often they are nowhere close as my friends in toronto
ya he must have helped you out a lot
you should maintain friendship with him but just make it clear with him to not do any crazy stuffs lol
was that the same guy who molested you
ð§
i am sorry that kind of stuff happened to you its not right
i think you can keep an open mind about things and show your interest in other people thats the best way to make friends making friends for the sake of making friends doesnt work very well
ya i think both of us can work on our social skill lol i will work on mine you work on yours
well thats usually how things go
i can attest that is probably a sign that he wanted to treat you like somebody special cuz i did the same thing to a girl once before lol yo i am gonna go to sleep now
thanks sara good night i love you
hey everything alright with you
nice how does it taste
ya it looks delicious i normally add pork or beef to it but you added chicken
oh so you were watching video aint that diligent
chicken is fine man i am so bored of my job now cant wait until this whole thing finishes
there are so many things you can fight in life but you cant fight boredom boredom gets rid of your will to fight
ya unfortunately i will be bored of many things in life
yes that can happen i am taking a small break from boredom now
it was delicious
probably more delicious than yours sweet heart ð miso rice
comon i am joking aint you go no sense of humor got
you should watch some dota2 games tomorrow
ok
when are you back on friday
ok
i need you to distract me from work
ð ok go do your stuff
oh i am so sorry i didnt check your message i wasnt that bored after i talked to you but my eyes are tired
yo i read that watched that video of the comment you mentioned me on and that was a really good creepy story
i liked it a lot
what do you mean
ya
lol ya that is right i think any normal sis would not open the door when you watched that did you feel the tension in the story
lol am i too intellectual for you
oh is that right you are so damn smart aint you
well i got nothing to say to that
i helped my father assemble bbq machine and rested
i am gonna go to sleep now actually i need to wake up early tomorrow to cook some food for potluck
of course sweet heart
we can both be dumb and smart but we cant know for sure when we will be one of them
almost like schrodingers brain
you know who schrodinger is right anyways you can search him up on your own i am sleeping later
you sent a photo the potluck
you sent a photo that one is made by me lol nobody wants it
yup
helloooo so like this is just all hypothetical at this point but i came to the realization taht the protein that we are studying is actually performing a function taht we didnt previously know about do you understand
yes disruption of that protein causes low motor control
and i think we found the mechanism of how that happens in the disease
weaver syndrome
lol no you dont you wouldnt be so beautiful and smart as you are now if you have that syndrome
taht syndrome literally makes you look weird and retarded
dont congratulate me yet i need to find evidence from the literature to prove that i this hypothesis might be right and i am excited because today i found a lot of evidence suggesting that i am right
hell ya
lol i will stop being a scientist after the middle of this month i will just be a boyfriend starting in september
oh ya you prefer somebody with ambition and skill
haha ok i will do my best then
goddamn girl did it look fancy
you should buy it when you become rich
i will brb back
china might this years dota tournament again lol i am watching the games and they are doing well
but european teams are doing well too yes
there will be competition until saturday from 1230  930 i believe
and then there will be games again from august 8  12 yes do you want me to link you the page
ok i wont send it then i am still looking into my scientific discovery lol
yes it is exciting and i am at the stage where it is very exciting because there is potential for new findings most people at this stage dont stop working because they are so interested
ya for sure lemme just go get that discovery of the century 25yearold nonscientist get nobel prize that would be a good headline
is it getting on your bed
my deepest condolences to you
thank you sweet heart but i wouldnt have minded sleeping on a bloody bed
good night love you
oh awesome so then i will see you early
probably 10
awesome
ð looking forward to it
yo i am watching dota2 how was your day
the games end at 12 i think
but i will stop after this i am slacking off so hard today and yesterday
it is interesting and fun to watch and relaxing too
lol of course they are professionals they earn money for playing this game
it depends on tournament winning if they win this torunament then each person of a 5man team gets more than 1 million
yup
they have sponsors to advertise their product
i dont know how their salary is they get a certain amount i think
but most of it comes from tournament winning
good work you did well today
i say that cuz you worked hard probably ð i actually dont know for sure but i am assuming cuz you are a diligent girl
whats your plan this time
lol ok i am gonna eat a little before i come so i dont get hungry
thanks â¤ï¸
we are like husband and wife
lol i think i am lucky
it doesnt matter if you cook for me
i would have taken up that duty if you didnt
i wouldnt care lol
ya i will
i came into contact with someone from game industry today i hope to get a reply back from that person she told me to contact her email
i use this app called shapr it is a entreprenur matching app she and i matched in our interest and i contacted her then she replied and told me to chat with her by email
i just want connections i dont know if she can help me but it is worth contacting her to see what she can offer
ya hopefully so far she hasnt replied back lol
no it is for anybody
as for company it is called manggo entertainment she is looking for talented people to work with she want to expand her business to canada
i am one of those talents ð
hey good night i am gonna see you tomorrow
we gonna fuck all night lol
love you sara see you tomorrow
yo i think i just made a huge fucking discovery for the lab the hypothesis i was telling you about the other day was right and i found evidence in my own data that support that hypothesis
i dont know some people in the lab might critique my work because that is what scientists do i just came back from a lab lunch i am leaving work at 3pm again
ya no problem well as long as i show them evidence they will approve but now i dont feel so hot about my discovery because i talked to somebody in the lab and it might not be that significant
aww â¤ï¸ you are da best
hello sweet heart
not much to do these days i am writing a report but that is very boring right now it might get more fun later on how about you
lol if you have time to play video games it just means that things are not that busy now you should just enjoy the time
oh nice
i am not actually working now i am watching dota2
everybody at my work place went to picnic
if you feel guilty about playing games all day you should do some research on jobs otherwise just enjoy yourself
ok sweet heart have a good rest
yo whats up sara
hello i guess i will chat with you later then before you go did they say anything last time you were late for work
lol so they didnt notice
ok that is an admirable spirit didnt know you were that serious about work
yes really well it is more like i dont interact with people like you that often
how so
i have interacted with people who dont give a shit about this type of situation whatever girl you gonna work hard
chinese team is dominating at the international 2017 you might be happy about that my favourite team is eliminated lol
lol is that right girl
ok i will keep that in mind
who is your favorite character tracer
the other day i saw a pornography of overwatch characters i was surprised to see it and widowmaker and tracers were doing crazy shits
what is 14 elimination
oh i see
well arent you the skilled player
haha
really now what is your goal from this get to the top
go play her then i probably wont play because i am trying to avoid getting addicted to games but i remember two years ago i was absolutely into dota2 spent countless hours on that game
oh so you arent gonna spend countless hours on it
good for you i am gonna leave work to go back home
if you want to contact me text me by phone dont use fb
hello my princess you feeling lonely in ottawa
i feel bad not coming over to visit you but believe it or not september is coming very soon have you contacted alain
i will try not feeling bad i think i am going to read lots of books and play lots of games for the remaining summer it will be very relaxing
lol so maybe i need to come help you
but are you able to carry those stuffs
what day
ok but think about it now how do you plan on moving your stuffs oh wait i see alain can still help you but you will be the one to carry the luggages
oh right i guess you could do that
not a thang
well nobody said you are gonna die and i actually dont think it will be a problem for you since you moved those luggages all by yourself when you moved to ottawa
alright
lol i am glad that i dont have to help you i am a lazy ass
hahaha i will help you in due time the opportunity is just not here yet hey all jokes aside if you need me just let me know i am happy to help how are you sweet heart

i dont know how people can be sexually insensitive
i just cant understand how that is possible
well i can do multiple times and i think that is normal your ex might have been an exception
lol well you dont have that problem with me
do i sound like i am mad
i use that word all the time
with my friends that aint mad
i am super polite to you when i chat with you but i think i should stop being too polite
because that creates a distance between us
so i should still be a gentleman to you
sounds like you want me to treat you like a lady and i act like a gentleman i am ok with that i should learn how to handle ladies anyways
oh my princess i love you so much
you super serious now

i am gonna make a game in a room and i have an experimental idea
i realized that i just need to make something regardless of whether it will be a bad game or not because i cant learn without making mistakes
i am thinking i should go visit you when you are moving contemplating that now my father told me to do what i want to do

exorcism of emily hill is good the english is easier to understand

nice hey i hate to ask you this but do you mind if i rest in peace for the night i am dead tired now
lets talk got tomorrow at work
good night sweet heart i love you so much ð
yo whats up
yes i am bored to hell now i need your help to keep me awake
i just started writing my work report but i am not very motivated
ya sure you sent an attachment do you understand
i dont find it that interesting because i work on it everyday i work on it to death when are you going to work 5pm
go ahead sweet heart dont oversleep
ya i will try my best
i will try my best
talking to friends you just came back from work
philosophical stuffs lol
would you like to discuss philosophy
i am glad you do
we are done but we were talking about human management and ai
ya like the person i was talking to was a demanding person she wanted her peers to aim for excellence for things they do but her peers are all slackers what should she do in this scenario
you mean she should just switch group
she complains that the reason why these people are slacking off is because the system is not motivating them hard enough so she was advocating for the system to change
ya thats what i told her
i guess her system was generated by a bunch of slackers
to be honest that is probably the case the second thing we were talking about was ai
ai that simulates human sentience
we were debating whether there is any meaning in interacting with such an ai because she claimed that ai do not have sympathy since it is all programmed
i told her that anything can be programmed including sympathy and if people want to believe that it is true sympathy people will believe it and treat it as such
ya that is exactly what i told her too our brain is programmed by evolution to behave in certain ways just like how ai is programmed
there is nothing that separates us from ai in terms of the crude way our mind functions
i think our mind functions in a crude way just a bunch of chemical reactions
ya lol
you mean the way i react to your naked body or the term crude way i am gonna go brush my teeth brb
lol if i wanted i could have controlled myself how about dat
no
well so far i havent
but i can do it if you challenge me
lol when you see my body
stonelike lol
yo i am gonna sleep now
will chat with you tomorrow good night
ð
love you too you sent a sticker what the hell is whats up gurl
man i thought that place was too defenseless bike stealing happens all the time how much was it 200 this shit aint right
how are you going to do that what trace has the burglars left
unfortunate you are unlikely to get the bike back but it is still worth reporting there are so many assholes in this world
they steal anything they can get their hands on your bike was very vulnerable and they just took that opportunity
that is a lot of money but you still gotta move on am i annoying you
goddamn it at least now you know you cant leave your bike out not over night you cant i am gonna leave work now i will chat with you in an hour but keep yourself in peace
love you too sweet heart
ð i am going to sleep now cuz i got to wake up early tomorrow to prepare for the poster presentation good night sweet heart love you
you sent a photo
haha i look kinda bad here my eyes are squinted how was your day so far
thats good
oh sweet heart ok i will chat with you later tonight then
yes tomorrow is my last day but i will keep in touch with them
excellent
lol no and there is not a whole lot you can do about that
yo i am playing dota now my friend got me back into it
my house mate
but i will quit today after this last game
no he is not here
he was my roommate
ya unfortunately
nah i am done but i think i will go to sleep
this game is so full of shit really lol good night
yoyoyo i am gonna come visit you next weekend to help with your move
when are you moving
oh ok i can still come no problem with me
i am watching anime
no work today
the anime
i think it is entertaining it is about the relationship between some high school gamers mostly played for comedy
yes really
well i am a gamer
yaa i thought we would have similar interest in games when we started dating but i guess that is not the case
but it aint that big of a deal
i think it is mostly because i quit games after we started dating
games that take a lot of time at least ya
no way i am gonna spend 15 hours a week playing games i quit last night after losing 5 games in a row are you still playing overwatch
ya it is not meant to be serious my misfortunes are often funny to people
you dont get addicted
i wish i had better self control like you
what game
oh right the main reason why i am not getting overwatch now is because i dont want to pay for it
it is not that i dont want to play with you
40 is a lot especially for a game that i will only play casually
if it was free to play then i would get it but of course they wont make any money like that
nah i dont want to play it if you arent playing with me
games like that take a certain amount of time to get good i dont want to play like a noob
i may get it one day if i truly want it
but for now i am reserved but i have seen all of the overwatch cinematics though they are like disney movies
except disney movies dont usually have bigbreasted ladies which one was it
the one with the fight at museum lol what 55 min
i see it is not really a movie but a compilation of every cinematics so whatchu doing now sweet heart games game of throne
ace combat interesting there are some nice looking games in the video it slightly makes me want to play them
they got some nice games on there but the thing is the trailers made the games looked good i might get bored of it when i actually play
you had a ps vita before right
i am gonna finish the jew book and then i am gonna buy more books
or download more books and read them
jewish it is a book about the history of jews kind of like that book you made me read about cambodia when i visited you
i am a scholar
jewish people is a great ethnic group that has contributed towards the worlds technology and business
i want to understand their history and what makes them so intelligent and so powerful do you think i am weird
you definitely need a purpose for reading them a natural curiosity for this kind of stuff otherwise it will get boring yo i am gonna sign off for the night are you gonna sleep too
alright good night then
ð
yo how are you doing sweet heart
i will probably come on sunday morning
it was good i learnt a lot
haha i guess i got some clues they are not necessarily that much smarter but they just think in a different way
and probably a result of cultural diligence i think it has more to do with culture i didnt get anything that tells me that they are smarter
they contributed a lot to the world
i dont know yet
but i know that they have a cultural foundation in business and medicine and that foundation may help them excel in mathematics and science
oh one other thing they care a lot about education
not in the same way that chinese care though
ya the difference between chinese and jew is that chinese wants kids to get high grades but jews actually care about the learning content because learning was an important survival skill during middle ages
so they are smart because of a lot of cultural foundations
lol me telling you about this
i recommend you to read about them
oh um it doesnt matter to me i think i will have to leave at least by tuesday
it depends
of course me too
i dont have any problem staying longer in fact that house is mine as well
there are actually so many things i want to do before school starts
read books meet a prof who wrote the recommendation letter for me to get my summer job
you dont mind
yes um he was a professor my father used to work with and he has helped me with all my applications that need reference letters
i need to go pay my respect and thank him for giving me the reference letter for this summer job
toronto
and my friends want to play mahjong again lol
ya go ahead you dont know the rules for the version taht we play though it is more complex than the chinese version
each version is probably really simple that is the general impression that i have about chinese mahjong
i also want to think more about my next game dev project i already got the idea now i just need to think of ways to implement it
have you done any sort of studying recently you mentioned you have more time now or something since you switched to the new place
ð¬ that is madness when did you get back home then
so youve been working since 9am you can go ahead and sleep i am gonna go take care of a business and go to sleep
i need to go talk to the neighbor to shut down their loud music they are disrupting the entire neighborhood
i will go talk to them personally they will understand i will talk with you later
good night sweet heart love you
ð
nah they wouldnt listen
i dont want to make this a big deal especially when my parents are already sleeping
i should call them but i am not entirely sure
ya are you gonna sleep or are you gonna stay awake
sorry went to sleep early yesterday had to wake up early for a trip i am going to thousand island today
thanks sara it was ok we went on a boat cruise it was about exciting as you would imagine let me know when you get back from work tonight
lol i wasnt intending it for it to sound exciting we just sat on a boat
and looked at an old castle
it was what you would expect lol it was so plain that i didnt take any photo
boldt castle in thousand island
hey whats up i am gonna talk with you again tomorrow huh good night
ð hey just to confirm with you i am gonna come over on sunday morning will be there at around afternoon dat cool with you
great i am going to sleep now eyes too tired good night and love you
ok you are around i didnt know that
nice how was it
you are still a waitress right
so you wont be working when school starts
once a week
well good to hear that you will have more time to rfocus on other things
and you hopefully you wont work 11 hour shifts
what is it
your current laptop is not good enough
you should get a mac then mac has the best battery life
what is your budget
alright ya that is a good one i was gonna suggest that
you can spend some money on an external hard drive you dont need much ssd
hmm that might be a bit low
are you using it for purely work
256 is a good amount
i might use your desktop often lol mostly for games
now i want a desktop pc
i want one but i wont get one for a while wont get one until i have lots of money
i am gonna be really free this semester
but i am gonna fill up my time with game dev
and readings
what are you so happy about
haha ok but my readings are complex i am getting into philosophy and social science
do you like those
alright nothing better than nerdy people
when do you usually start working these days i am asking you this because i am wondering if you had enough free time to do things you want to do
in the morning
ok today i went out for a walk at night and i realized that there are so many things i want to do in my life like the readings is something i recently i wanted to do
oh ya
ya starting a family as this point definitely seems like a huge responsibility to me as well
you are only 23 still got time girl gotta make your next few years count
yes no more trips for me this summer but yo i once saw this dude who was a millionaire who had a family and a kid he didnt touch any of the money he earned from business
ya suitable partner is another key you so far seem like that suitable person or maybe i am wrong ð
ya these next four months will be the real test for suitability
ya you should i am gonna sleep now chat tomorrow
alright good night then
you will see me on sunday for sure i will stay until tuesday morning probably
haha ya that would be nice
good night sweet heart
love you
whats up girl i was at lunch with the people from my workplace
15
not exactly the best there is there can be upgrades made to my laptop but the basic model is the best one
are you buying
yes
nope never needed a printer in dorm always used the university printer
lol that is nice you gonna get it
go do it i went to apple store just now and i didnt find anything i want to biu buy
i see i am currently at indigo i want to buy this book but it costs like 40
i will probably buy it on amazon for cheaper
discovery of insulin i didnt send a photo takes too much data lol i am gonna leave now talk to me by phone text i dont want to use data
are you done work sweet heart
it was good i came back home relaxed and worked on my game how was work
i was trying to buy the book i told you about on kindle but they dont have kindle for it not even pdf which is strange considering it was published more than 25 years ago
ya i probably will have to have you recently contacted alain about the move in he knows you are coming that day right
ok great well you can almost leave daly must feel nice about that
ya it is unfortunate that is one thing we lose when we live far away from downtown but i am actually quite happy about it because i get to walk more
more walk more exercise
walk for more than an hour everyday seems good to me the thing is i prefer exercise be integrated in my daily life
yes probably will only fourty minute walk
do you want to join me
haha ok we will get the student card
we will have unlimited access to buses but it is up to us to use it
right for a second it looked like up ass ð
up your ass is what it sounds like do you know what that means
i stick my dick up your ass is what that means
ya i am a funny giy by the way have you gotten anything back about your lost bike and are you gonna get a new bike to be frank i wouldnt get a bike if i were you
you mean you dont want to spend another 200 or all other bikes cost more
ya good choice you should save money for now and you dont need a bike you can join me and walk to school everyday you wouldnt have to go to gym to exercise ð
you know the unfortunate thing about bus is that you get dizzy if you read or do work on your laptop on a bus if i dont get dizzy i would take bus too
you mean you worry that you are gonna get super tired walking is not endless at least compared to buses
at buses you can sometimes wait for 30 min and the bus dont come now thats endless waiting
oh ok that makes sense
i dont have data and i dont have any friends to text to
you should just do what you want but i understand that most people will probably think i am crazy to walk 80 minsday fucking cowards ð
lol thanks i am just joking around of course you know i am joking around right
oh ya
well i am a lucky guy you da best girl ð
i gained a lot of weight this summer 3kg
so exercising by walking everyday is a big deal to me ya
you like fat sweaty guy sticking his dick in your vagina do you actually prefer fat guys over thin guys
you know in asian pornography there are a lot of fat asian men i have no idea why they hire mostly fat guys on the other hand western pornography have lots of wellbuilt men
its ok i thought maybe you had some ideas about this yo i am gonna sleep now unless you want to say anything
i am fascinated by the subject like a scientist and i like to bring sex jokes onto the table i am not that carnally hungry
thank you for letting me sleep i love you too i will see you around good night hey whats up sweet heart done work yet
oh nice
you made your move fast so you got it from best buy
oh really
they gave you the printer
nice how much was the macbook which model is it
that is not a bad price honestly didnt need to pay like 3400 at least but mine has better graphic card
ya i understand i am just remarking about your laptop you have two usb3 ports which is good mine only has thunderbolt
you should get the external harddrive they only cost like 40 for cheap ones
the one i have is 1tb
ya that one is very expensive the one in the apple store might be faster than mine well how do you like your macbook so far used it yet
you mean microsoft office
unpack them after i help you move lol your room must be like an utter clutter now how am i gonna spend the night there
oh ya girl well i am glad we will be sleeping in the big room on monday
i will be leaving on tuesday morning is anything going on in ottawa when i am there
i can do whatever last time we visited the museum together we were so awkward
no
i might need better clothes i will have to see
but i am trying to not spend too much money on unnecessary things right now
but if you find some clothes that suit me well i might consider buying
ya anything
today i spent the whole day making the prototype for my video game and i got it working you should play it when i come over
it is interesting ð
you will find out i will say though it is a puzzle game
oh ya did you find anything interestinf
what magazine
that is a cool magazine science and technology kind of like scientific american
subscribed or described
you may change your interest at some point in your life we are still young we can change rapidly
hey i am gonna go to sleep now is that cool
alright then
thank you sweet heart good night
love you
it is on tuesday talk to me on phone message i dont want to use data
i was out the whole day with my friends on the way back home now how was your day
i see i am gonna walk on the road i will talk to you in a bit
i just did let me take care of the house first i am done yo you sleeping now
not until i chat with my dear girlfriend
ya mahjong
so it is cold in ottawa
right i kind of have to do that too the line must be huge right now
why student card
i did not know that
mine doesnt expire for another few years yo why did you ask me about when my classes start
oh ok my first week is very relaxing but then the week after that is going to start getting busu
i imagine you would be studying all day when school starts right ð
yes why do you ask
there shouldnt be a problem but can i borrow your key while you are out unless you want me to come with you or maybe i should ask alain for my key when we meet him
when you are outside i need to stay in a room
lol who is this joker you are meeting
pick you up or be with you all the time
ok well i will ask for my key anyways
hopefully i can park on the road over there what is the address of the house again
park in school dont think that is allowed
ya that is no problem but i was asking who is this joker
what organization is offering this course
uottawa
interesting no problem are there also courses that focus on communication
that is too bad well you should check you need that skill more than writing
based on what i observed of you in class
you are too scared of saying anything because you dont know if you can say things right
oh ya by the way one general advice for your english learning dont take things too seriously it is ok to make mistakes when you talk nobody will judge you for it especially for an international student like you
i know it is hard to do though because we are used to thinking seriously i am the same as you but we need to change that
make love with me to thank me
how much are they selling for
just make sure you get it after you move out
you can store the bike in my room if it is easier
since i am on the first floor
ya but you are gonna have to wake up early everydau
the only good sleeping schedule
awww i am very happy to hear dat
hey i am gonna go to sleep now since it is late
good night and love you
ð hey sweet heart you working again today
nah i just wanted to chat because i am bored from reading book al day
around 12 i will come between 122pm dat cool with you
alright finally back from work
yea
but you will be around in the morning right
when are you working tomorrow oh ok
ottawa is pretty cool these days just like toronto and tomorrow will be cool too i believe
glad that is the case your room is usually so hot ok i will bring my harvard jacket
people will know that you are dating a smart man from harvard on the steeet street
lol really
do you know what kind of people they are can you judge
in your part time work
i am sure they all got tired of being smart and decided to do part time in a restaurant in ottawa
he is in undergrad ottawa
what year is he in
if he is not first year then it means he didnt get in coop
he is going to second year
ok that makes sense engineers typically do coop during summer they dont do part time in a restaurant unless you just finished first year for comp eng coop doesnt start until next summer
i like to analyze it is kind of a habit that i built up my family is also very judgmental and it is often times a bad habit for them
thanks sweet heart i enjoy judging people but i know that most of the times it is not good to judge so i keep myself from judging
so you cool with dat
or do you got a problem lol ok
i also think you are judgmental when you talk about your trash classmates
i am ok but we should really move away from it i wont judge you for being judgmental
but one thing i do agree with you is that your classmates do not have a positive attitude for learning and it is a good idea to spend more time with people like me instead of your classmates
well what does he understand you guys are on different levels i want to ask you how did you guys start dating in the first place what was his reason for dating you
who was the one to ask to start a relationship
did you ever ask him why he liked you lol
i guess he didnt know enough
you just told me he doesnt like your judgmental attitude and there are a lot of other reasons why he didnt like you to end the relationship i dont know what they are of course
you guys met in the first semester right
i see i am just curious because he is older than both of us and he probably had other relationships in the past
lol damn girl and i thought me being virgin till 25 was considered late
anyways my impression of him is that he is immature for his age
ya he beat me but he dated someone he didnt know much about
i see then maybe he was inexperienced in relationship like i was cuz that sounds like me
when i hear anything related to antisocial behavior it just reminds of me
lol now you cant judge peoples intelligence by their looks
that is called not sociable
but he might be hardworking or mathematically inclined i think you might say that he doesnt show confidence socially that is probably the proper way to say it
no problem sweet heart and i gotta sleep
you are gonna get fat eating stuffs at night
but enjoy your beef i will see you tomorrow
love you
bye
please get ready to get back home by 1200pm that is when i will arrive
it is in your room
i will wait for you upstairs
came back to toronto
i spent the entire day after coming back watching videos about overwatch lol they really need to make a story mode for the game
reading and watching stories is not a waste of time some people like it some not and evidently you appreciate it too otherwise you wouldnt have seen the video about mei you may one day reach that conclusion too
hahahaha well said that is the essence of video games like overwatch and dota2 i perfectly understand your situation but you will realize eventually that gaining happiness by beating others itself is meaningless
oh really that is too bad you can put it in my room if you want ð
that is why i have the big table
you are saying our neighborhood is not safe
you know what if you dont want to put anything in my room that is ok
then what are you saying
i dont want to disappoint anybody and by the off chance that somebody does break into my room and steal your computer i will feel really bad about it but i think that is unlikely to happen
go to work
oh
i dont got any problem with that it is your desktop
oh goooood i forgot to ask you are you at home on saturday
ok if alain gives you the key to my room tell him to keep it since you will not be there when i move in
and tell him that i will need him to give me the key on saturday you would have been forced to meet with my mother if you were in the house on saturday lol
awwwww you are so sweet
lol kind of too late for that i wouldnt have cared even if you dont say thanks
yes i still remember whats going on with you
ok what did you do today i want to know what you did in detail
wait i thought you didnt work oh wait nevermind you didnt work 11am
no i think it is normal in your case yo i got to go lets talk later
a guest came over and i had to chat with her i already had my dinner sorry about the sudden disappearance
sorry dota right now lol
nope finished we played two games me and my friend
we won in the end so it was pretty satisfying i lost like 20 games or so when i played with him in the past never a single win
yup he is doing mba
what should i play with you
i cant play overwatch on mac anyways i gotta actually wake up early tomorrow to send my father to airport i will chat with you tomorrow ok
is there anything you would like to say
thanks sweet heart
i will let them know you said this they will be happy
aright good night
i by the way
i dreamt about you last night
yes
i was surprised at myself that it took me this long for you to appear in my dream i forgot something about a school festival you and i were in it
and my ex suddenly appeared out of nowhere being angry that i am dating you
and then i woke up
you are more beautiful
but she has big chest lol
maybe same or smaller than yours
lol
i dont care much about breast size
elegance dressing and smile
smiling itself makes a woman beautiful then please do them
you not smiling often is partly my fault because i am not a fun guy to be around with
your ex doesnt have the right to ask you that smile is earnes earned not deserves not deserved i see you smile when we chat about fun stuffs
earned is you put effort into making things happen
deserved is more like expectation your ex entered the relationship expecting a lot of things but he didnt put any effort into cultivating the relationship is there anything more you want to say
ok
i love you too good night
yo whats up
it was great i am reading about an article about business in the mobile game market you are up early today pretty early for you to chat with me
so whats the occasion today
lol you are working at 11am
did anything happen at the work place
or is this just a sudden realization
right thats what i meant maybe you should quit then do you need the money
ok
you will see me on saturday
love you too let me know how later how you feel about the job we can talk about it later if you want
yo sorry i didnt see your message for some reason i didnt get a notification maybe you should come back home early once school starts and my father said thanks to your message
i can wait for you for that class
but then you would have to walk back home with me instead of biking
much appreciated
bus on the day night days late night
not anywhere close
that is fine
ok i am gonna dota
yeah have fun at work
yo i won 3 lost 4 i am gonna play in a tournament tomorrow with one of my friends because playing by myself is too time wasting
yes at 9pm
so you are gonna be out for the whole day tomorrow when do i get to see you
so who are you coming back home with do you need me to come for you
well suit yourself you still havent explained to me your method i am just curious do you take a taxi or something

it starts at 9pm
yes are you off work today or not working sorry i meant off work as of now

ok are you coming back now
but the class ended early ya
ok i am going to sleep now gotta wake up early tomorrow
good night
ok yo when are you coming back
to thesis oh wait msc master of science
msc doesnt necessarily mean thesis you need to clearly express what you are trying to say i dont know what you are saying
well if that is what you want then that is what you should do but i am curious what is the new program you are switching into
oh i see well congratulations for getting a thesis you are going to get a lot of practical experience from the thesis and practical experience is very valuable
have you figured out the details of the thesis project yet or do you know any details like pay start date supervisor
immediately you can do that in the middle of the semester
i see
well it is still better than nothing guess you are gonna get busy then huh today i had a very pleasant interview not sure if i am going to get the job though
i answered all of their questions excellently
i am only worried that other people might have more incredible codes to show other people to the interview interviewer
comon sara i think you are overestimating my skill i am competing with 2nd and 3rd year students they have done crazy things in the past but yes i should be satisfied with the interview
we will find out on 16th
when are you coming back i was planning to make some instant noodle tonight but i dont have any ingredients so i thought to ask you to buy some
ok i will wait for you to get back home then i am gonna rest up and then study
ok i made some of instant noodle again since you liked it so much last time
wow you are so active
ya they will just be soft
ok i am waiting for you we can warm up some noodles and have dinner together
thank you for letting me know my room is closed off so nothing can enter now
haha thats what happens
ok sweet heart
what kind of cap and brush oh hat
i have a big brush but it is used for cleaning bathtub sinks
not sure if it can clean cap
why is that
i didnt know it was toilet garbage
she is very disorganized but she is not necessarily a weirdo weirdo suggests psychological problems
did what on purpose she didnt clean her plates
i think she was just too lazy
and i dont know about the garbage bin in the kitchen she might have been drunk or something
right she might have been doing drugs
i can sometimes smell the marijuana if this is bothering you then talk to alain you should talk to him soon he is gonna leave this month
hmmm i cant say anything about this because i am not the one bothered by this you should confront her about this if you got a problem
no
yes
i didnt even know if that that toilet garbage bin and if it was i would just put it somewhere else and not give a shit
it didnt bother me none
dont think it has everyones shit that gets flushed down the toilet but i understand you are disgusted by the toilet bin or she was just high
you put wiped shit paper in the garbage why dont you just throw it into the toilet
you are supposed to throw everything you wipe your ass with into the toilet regardless of whether it has hair lol
everything that you dont wipe your ass with lol i throw my floss in there
garbage
i dont consider pad to have shit lol yo forget about this the bottomline is that lady had a problem
hey look if you got a problem why dont you talk to her in person i cant do anything for you even if you complain all of these problems with me
the problem with involving me in this situation is that i am the least knowledgeable about these issues and i dont have the confidence to talk to her about these issues
well i am thinking about this problem from a productive perspective i wouldnt act on this issue unless there is a good solution to the problem what we need is a true confrontation
alright
studying
i am gonna go throw some garbage out now
recycling
this is a very redundant sentence people will understand what you are saying but nobody will ever say it
like this hard to say what context do you want to say this in maybe it is easier for me to take initiative when i am not distracted thinking on my own is a very vague phrase
well yes they are weird
are you going to submit that
when do you need to submit it
lol
well just tell them this dont say anything about deep stuff because there are deep stuffs in taking courses too
what you should be telling them is that you learned many things in the past year and that it is time for you to take on a project
complete the thesis not my
switch
remove here remove the last two sentences and replace that with i am confident that this project can be successful and it will be a great opportunity for me to gain practical experience
no remove which is another attractive part of doing thesis
it is still shit but i think you can submit it
you did your best aint nothing more you can do i would rewrite some parts but you have conveyed your idea efficiently in this oh ya replace very appreciate for your approval with i would greatly appreciate your approval
gggggggggg
you did your best you should have asked me about this earlier i could have helped your ass
you tried your best
yes waiting for it now
thanks
i did what i could the interviewer was not very enthusiastic
who knows do you have anymore classes
ok you will have many interviews if you apply to a hundred jobs
no i got class till 10pm
yes
no idea 830 maybe
please dont rely on me physically and psychologically
why
dont depend on me so much it is psychologically unhealthy
no but when you say it like that it adds unnecessary pressure on me
dat i need to full fill your need perfectly
look i think you need to calm your ass first that thing with the pressure was a lie thats actually not what i wanted to say
maybe you didnt mean it in that way but certainly thats what it sounded like
lol girl are you mad again
ok sure i am far less attractive than drugs i am not insulted from that if that is what you are trying to do
yo those werent pressures as i said i made a mistake those werent pressures forget i said anything about pressure
ok you can certainly rely on me but you should not depend on me to provide you with a meaning for life or a reason for existence
like i said when you said you need me psychologically and physically that honestly sounded like something a drug addict would say
i know you dont think like that but you got to be precise with what you say
sure ok you wanna fuck i understand that i aint gonna stop you from wanting to have sex but i cant just fuck a girl when i am sick talk by phone messaging dont wanna use data
ok
for what you are meeting with your supervisor
you sent it like two days ago
administrations are usually very slow you can go talk to them in person
just send him an email explaining your concern and ask what you can do about it or whether it is something worth worrying about i am having back to back interviews with little breaks everything ok with you hello
so how is everything going you dying of anxiety
about you
hard to listen to shit talkers huh
i had that experience before tooo not pleasant
just had one like an hour ago thanks sweet heart
ya one hour ago this dude in the interview waiting room was loudly talking about his gpas and accomplishments and shit like his gpa is shittier than mine but i still didnt like him talking about it anyways
what is important is your program switch and my interviews did you take care of your business with the master program
ok i hope you get your ass in the program
ok sweet heart wanna have lunch at 1pm
alright see you then when are you going to reach the restaurant
ok i will go to the restaurant now i am inside the restaurant got a table for us
okk
congratulaions really happy to hear that
is there a problem
why no subscription to journal where are you now
ya then that will be problematic
normally i dont read newly published articles unless i am an expert in the topic
you are not an expert in your field so i have no idea why you would want to access those articles
shit yaaa hey i got an advice though even if you have no access to the article you might have access to the other cited articles those cited articles might be more accessible the references is what i mean
great
i am in morriset library
i probably will come back home it happens at 8pm but i will be back very late tonight the competition itself usually lasts 24 hours but i will come back early because i got assignments to do
yes
what about this
i can figure this out
why do you need to know this i dont wanna type it out i dont remember the exact syntax in python if i write a code i have to do some research again which will take some time
like a one day trip
what do you wanna do there there are some interesting places you just want to visit places
if i am going to a new city that is the only thing i will be doing other than eating great food
i went there like probably more than 10 years ago
and i dont remember anything from that city
ya we need to go somewhere together quebec is a nice place to go but we got to book hotel and train ticket
wtf is airbnb
well if that is what you like then we gotta do some plannings huh
i want to know what would you do if i say no i dont want to go with you
to be perfectly honest with you i am definitely not as enthusiastic about going to quebec as you are but i am in a low mood right now so maybe that is making me feel unenthusiastic
maybe i will feel better during reading week
i dont like hiding my feeling but anyways
yo i am going to refuse this for now
that is no problem real sorry about this at the moment i feel like i am not going to be in the mood to do anything by the time i go with you
sorry forgot to do it i will set an alarm for tomorrow to ask my parents sorry about this good night sweet heart i feel like i am back in shape again academically
mentally ready to study night
my parents will come near lunch time next monday and they will leave at latest at lunch time on tuesday my parents want to know if you want to join us to go to a park on monday

what happened it is ok though
alright can i tell this to my parents now or do you want to change your mind yo if that is your decision i need to tell my parents about this are you absolutely sure about this
haha nice maybe i should go visit you someday where is your lab

i cant i got no pump
you can take the bike into the bus
then go ask them
what are you saying
no body but a pump
do you know how to use a pump
do you see a hose do you see the air pumping tube on your bike tire
yes and you pump it
you open the hose first then you connect the hose to tire then you clamp the hose and you pump
it is ok just close the cap and use your hand to grip your tire to see if your tire feel strong just close the cap if it feels strong then you got air is everything working fine
i care about you girl but i cant leave this goddamn class cuz it is a laboratory
no i dont fucking have a brwak cuz this is a 3 hour lab you better be joking when you say i dont care about you
well i am sorry to hear that girl but you learn from experience but it is certainly not my fault that you got hurt
lemme buy you drink tonight to make it up to you is that ok i love you so very much you know that how is it going sweet heart are you mad at me still
oh you are so sweeet i am already back home i had food at cafeteria not hungry but thanks you better be awake girl hello dear sara i got a good coop placement
you got dat right
ciena it is one of the biggest networking companies in the world
ya
that is too bad
well i guess we shouldnt interact with each other then
do you even know what antibody is
60
but my thesis was shit
good ones usually need around 100
oh i didnt you are so smart
girl i am not gonna wake you up tomorrow i am gonna sleep in
what you got some problems
you got me sick
so what now your body feels sick
i am sick too now buddy and that probably came from your recent sickness but you are saying your recent sickness came from me
how can i get sick from my own sickness sore throat
my original sickness came from you sweet heart
who knows i have no clue if you really dont want to get sick then dont come to my room i wont come to your room as well
i wont come again if you dont want to get sick how badly do you feel right now
you should eat some of my medicine
it helps with fever and head ache i am thinking about making some warm drink for you when you come back but i think they are useless do you want some
dont let you finish
what the fuck are you talking about i need my medicine to be my lunch tomorrow when are you coming back
ok
poor you i dont wanna get infected
hey can i come to your room to sleep again
these dumbasses in the kitchen just wont stop talking
i will talk to them at a later time i dont want to disrupt their fun i just talked to them hopefully they move quickly hey i forgot to ask you how are you feeling today
did you take my medicine
it is the unfortunate side effect of being sick do you have any food in your fridge for lunch
maybe you should rest on your bed for the whole day
i can warm up your food and bring it to your room if you want to swim then go but i think you will be incredibly tired or sick
excited for something
i dont know
todd says have a blessed day
i dont know who that joker is
it is a sound somebody makes when they are doing something happy like that little white pony
why is that
you are doing fine with research reaad papers
please spare me
hey when are you leaving tomorrow
ok
can i tell you how i feel about our relationship
my parents said a lot of negative things about you but they didnât really talk about any of your positive traits the stuffs they said doesnât have any relevance to the quality of our relationship but today i was affected a lot by what they said so i will ignore what they said about you
just the university and dating stuffs they are irrelevant
i think you acted fine
those things doesnât matter
even if you cooked good food they would still say negative things about you but the point is
that thing about you disagree about our first date
and the university
look
i donât think it is anybodyâs fault but it is a clash of conflixt clash of culture i mean my parents are conservative and close minded
which is why they donât want me to go to japan and why i am in uottawa in the first place
i want to say something else though well
you should be confident about your own self worth live a life that is full of happiness i think as long as you do those your character will change
i have seen confident people people who are more confident and happy than i am even though i am already very confident and happy myself my confidence comes from my experience and knowledge
anyways that is what i actually want from you as well
yes i believe so
i want yo say my second thought
i said this before at the moment i am only good at spending around an hour at a time with somebody after that i get incredibly tired but it is highly unlikely right now i like those times
i am not going to put effort into spending more time than i am already spending though because that is just mentally draining for me but i feel bad everytime i am not spending more time with you
the amount of time we are spending now is ok
but i want to let you know my expectation
if i donât make this expectation clear to you this relationship is painful for me
because i am always feeling bad not spending more time with you
i donât really know but it has been on my mind for a while whether thhat is a good choice or a bad choice
i will be honest with you
i donât think that is an issue i donât need others to take care of me and you have made good food for me but nothing you do amazes me anymore
you just seem like a hard working good girl to me right now
good night
i am sleepy now
hey are you still coming back home before saturday or you wonât be back until saturday
ok well have a nice trip then
you deserve it after all the heart break today i was also heart broken i cried a lot after our discussion in the morning
well this is all part of the process you did nothing wrong
you too howâs your trip so far
ok
lol
what did you do there
anything interesting
are you having fun in this trip
well i am glad you are having fun if i had gone with you i am not sure if i would have enjoyed it but it is good that at least you are having fun
oh ya
i will find out on saturday how many friends are you going with are you with
thats nice
montreal is kind of like ottawa though like any major city
well somewhere in between i dont find either one of them beautiful honestly lol
you know what maybe i have lived in these areas for a long time so i dont find them pretty anymore
but i think kyoto in japan is a nice city it has tons of beautiful locations anyways i am gonna go to sleep now kind of tired
good that you found it i was a bit worried for you when you told me and you are welcome for the food
have you studied for 6 hours today
hey whats up girl lol

ok i didnt go either too lazy to go if i am going i need somebody to drag me there oh my parents told me that they offer you to come stay with us during christmas
ya they know we broke up
haha of course i think if we spend time together during christmas without even being in a relationship that would be awkward where do you plan on going alaska
oh really
there are more adventures in alaska i would recommend going to banff banff is probably very snowy during winter but you get to hike the snow mountains yo are you still awake
can i sleep in your room again lol these fuckers downstair just donât stop talking i will keep myself civilized
jesus ok yo howâs it going sweet heart i just saw you come in the front door yo i want to ask you no bullshit what do you think of me going to japan
my parents told me that it is best to not play around with my career since i need to get married soon and shit do you feel that is a good reason to not to go to japan
lol can you describe in more detail your thought
haha you know who i am ya probably not gonna marry anytime soon

when you get back home please donât knock on my door i will be sleeping
what is homing
ok i look forward to having you back i am sleeping now please donât knock on my door good night my dear love mohammed moved out this saturday house is a lot cleaner now
he is absolute fucking dogshit fucking roommate leaves the house and kitchen ike fucking pigs den everybody in the huose is glad he is gone damages kitchen utensils and takes no responsibility
when are you coming back by the way i sure would want my bowl back yo a beautiful french girl took over avalonâs place
please dont make any noise when you come back
ð yo what is going on when are you coming back home i miss you a lot
yes why
so when are you coming back how are you doing i miss you so very much right now
i can drive you to school if you want
ya only if you can be my sex slave
so will you come back
when are you coming back yo serious talk do you fuck with your roommate
lol are you for serious this is serious talk
alright congratulations seriously i hope he will be good to you guess you wonât be my sex slave then
boys come after you like hordes you are like a magnet yo why arenât you responding you gotta talk to me more so you remember our good times
girl you had 3 boy friends within 1 year that is pretty crazy
yo do you agree with me when i say you attract boys a lot of boys
ânot many boys chase after meâ that is funny girl
wtf it is not
i am not saying it is a good thing
of course it shouldnât that is not a good sign lol but anyways i got the opposite problem not enough girls chase after me but that might change soon after i get more famous leading edge stuff
for japan it has to be done early so i donât have any issue with visa the interviews are for this fall
i donât think i will do any game dev in companies because i want to make my own games not follow other people
ya for sure i am working hard on my current game it will blow your mind when i finish
yo who is your new boyfriend i wanna harass him sorry i meant stalk him
does he have fb
how much younger is he
you need to tell me his name and link me to his social media
his name is not private though so whatâs his name
lol hahahahaha that is funny i am sure you also forgot the name of your undergrad university name ya you are a real joker you know that yo i am just teasing you you know that right
you are my business sweet heart because i love you very much even if you already have a boyfriend ð
shiiiieeeeeeeeet
lol
it is absolutely great ya why do you call him god father
haha ok i had lots of interviews to work in japan i am most likely going in september
no i worked the interviews happen at night so i can still work during the day
i mean yes they are all computation jobs i told you about this before how can you not remember
not necessarily
well i am still aiming for games i just want to do many things
whatâs reasonable
well yes i am not starting any trouble in the workplace so i guess i am good how is your boyfriend treating you
i donât play dota nowadays he fucks you up real good
how is life do you know that i still love you
tell me why
if that is the case then it is a huge problem you need to see a psychiatrist it ainât good to always hate life
when you have free time you hate life for 2 hours
like what life is too hard
when you come back can we fuck yo come visit me at fss
well hello
nope

so is it worthy or not worthy
that is exactly what i said earlier but ok i understand you didnât you say you have people who study hard friends and classmates
you gotta pump your soul with motivation aim for greatness and look for challenges does your boyfriend inspire you

a dear friend who fucks you
ok i dont really care honestly i was justp laying around with you but i wanna hear you say i love you please give me a second chance
you will how will you give me the second chance
lol how are you doing with your boy
lol who cares him you should care about him and i care about you
ya you are very dear to me you know that
because i care more about myself than you but i still care about you
are you ok with someone like me ð
you canât tell i am serious here
what
really i love you too sweet heart
ð can we fuck tomorrow
i will wait for you in my room
lol what happened all of a sudden did you ditch your boyfriend
lol ok
good night yo how are you doing girl enjoying the long weekend
from working i thought we were gonna fuck on wednesday i was waiting for you
wtf why
lol what a kid
is that why you wanna fuck me you got tired of him or was all of that horse shit
i am ok how is your life doing well with your boyfriend
my girlfriend did
what
lol
ok well i was joking
i aint got no girls right now man that was funny though are you like bored out of your mind or something
lol how do you plan on treasuring that
awww you are so sweet so you are coming back tonight
you are still living with your boyfriend right now
ok so what can we do when you come back a feast
i dont play mahjong by the way i only play with friends in real life
no fucking ð you promised me you would ð£
we can walk talk and eat fucking is only part of it yo are you looking for a job right now by the way i forgot when you are finishing school and entering the work force
ok i was just curious it would pain me greatly if canada decided to kick your ass back to china after graduating
no i mean if you have a hard time finding a job
you dont care if you cant stay in canada
a new place as in somewhere in canada or going back to your home country
do you not realize i was overexaggerating but i recently had a friend in uottawa who is an international student he couldnt get a coop job probably because of his language barrier and his lack of skill
but i still worry about you
lol trash people
i guess if you think about it like thatthen you got nothing to worry about
if all else fails you can always go to bootcamp
it is that 23 months programming training
you have opportunities to move up in rank even with 3 months of training
i love your confidence
oh nice do you plan on accepting it or trying out
you will have time you have time off of your work
you need to be with someone who can encourage you for example me ð
oh i enjoy staying with these two ladies at my work place they are nice to me too guided me so much in my understanding of my work
i actually really look forward to spending time with you when you come back but isnt your boyfriend going to be upset
lol you dont ð±ð½ð¹ð¡
lol are you for fucking real why does it matter to you how proud i am for my achievements
you think that i am a pitiful man for being so proud of myself
lol well you are doing the exact opposite i love it when people trash talks me like this
hahahaha
you are so incredibly funny you know that
i dont classify people as trash like you so i dont think you are trash
yes that is true in some sense but not trash
ok now you are just being immature it was funny the first time because it was so unexpected but now that the novelty has wore off it shows how narrow sighted you are
well you ainât gonna get any of that from me because i am full of kindness lemme tell you something important though
what you said just now reminds me of my past self
you need to forgive yourself and others and learn to love your fellow human beings
ð ðð
good luck on it to be honest i didnât do much for the project it was all chris he knew what to write on his reports
yes you need to come back home now so you can be with me on my bed
alone
your boyfriend is a classical chinese
are you for fucking real then whatâs the point of the relationship
i love you this is why your cellphone is always on lock
so that your boyfriend doesnât see your ex telling you he loves you
oh really oopsies better get rid of it
are you in lab now i am so lonely
can you come to my bed now
oh great i will miss you baby i will probably sleep though
hey sara how are you
can you be more specific
if you are asking if anybody ever postponed the things i needed to order then nobody did and if he is postponing then he should have told you
what was the reason for the postpone
ya you should definitely order as soon as you find out you need something but that has nothing to do with postponing
well at least he recognizes the problem
so he is not ordering even now
well you need to find out why ask him until you are satisfied
what is patâs position
i donât understand your situation girl you coming back to me this weekend you fucking promised
this is the last week i wont be home next weekend
yo girl i miss you so fucking much please please please come back home asap

ya
is your boyfriend gonna help
i really wanna help you out so i get a chance yo evaluate your boyfriend is that ok

why
i liked you too back then for that reason
i liked your butt and your ambition
your ambition was more important for me
yes you explicitly stated that when we first started dating that you were ambitious and there were things you wanted to do and i liked that i got sick and i got addicted to dota
i got addicted to dota because of school not because of you
so what do you say can we give it another shot
i will stand with you
why dont you want to stand with me
nope
oh no whats wrong
it is friday
where does it feel uncomfortable i was studying hey my research project is going fast fast fast
ya
i am doing so well here
because i am
why not i absolutely am my colleagues are all slacking off so hard here i am the hardest working researcher here
i love you that is why i talk to you
i need you to tell me how good i look in this photo
you sent a photo do i look good
are you serious
what is ugly
how about this one
you sent a photo
i dont know my resaerch is about studying human psychology
nothing discovered yet but we are going to find something very interesting
how we process visual information
it is technically classified i cannot tell you company policy
but lemme tell you what though honda is probably the worlds first company to create a functioning robot the research that i am doing now will help towards taht lemme brush my teeth bb
after i get off work i eat sometimes i study sometimes i chat with poeple on phone sometimes i jjust watch youtube videos
no my own personal thing
i read papers and program i design experiment
c
oh english
everything here is english
a lot of them are canadian from my program i rarely speak japanese here
canadian students
how is your boy doing
he is making you happy
why not
i want to know about your love life
you and your boy do not have a love life
why not
but then what is the point of having a bf
no matter what happens to you i will always love you you can always come back to me i will sleep now good day

you are pregnant
so what is happenign
sure
ok
ok i love breakup stories
lol dude lol
you attract so many fucking boys it is insane man
so there is more complexity behind what you just said
what s the complexity
he never would have said he liked you if he was still with his girlfriend sarah why are you so attractive you first attract me then you attract your friend then now you attract your lab technician
i know lol i know you are nothing but people care about your looks
no ugly girl would have 3 boy friends in a single year maybe it is easier for girls on my side i have to work hard to get a girlfriend
i am gone now girl later
my friends invited me to join  them exploring down town tokyo
about what
possibly
sure
ð
you have a lot of character flaws
you are irrational sometimes and you come to conclusion too quickly and you are ashamed of yourself in some way which is bad for your confidence
your education
and honestly you are a complete slob when you donât care about otherâs judgement
no lol i ainât angry you are just shit
lol girl you told me to say your flaws so i told you i still love you very much
i am sorry you have so much character flaws ð i wish you were perfect but you arenât you sent a photo you sent a photo you sent a photo you sent a photo you sent a photo ð
i am meeting a family friend she invited me out to lunch with her daughter
how about you girl how was your saturday
ð
why
career wise
awkward situation as in lack of friends in the dominant culture
right the cultural barrier problem
like international chinese friends
havent you made a few white friends here
i am sorry that is the case for you girl you need to speak english like a boss to be able to make friends here
you are bothered
but it is not worth doing i can relate to your problems like neither one of us are that socially outgoing but that also prevents us from experiencing the dominant culture which makes us worried about our social life
sorry you think they are not advanced people and you have no chance to compete or complete with them
i mean it is truly unfortunate that it is like that but i am also experiencing the same problem
hey you will never be alone i am here for you ð
lol
but yo honestly the way i learnt to deal with disparity in culture is just to out perform others through pure skill and strength
i feel like that is the only way you can survive in this society if you cannot fit in with others culturally but hey you are a girl so you will find boyfriends very easily
lol he is your savior sorry you never explained to me why you are bothered by your boyfriend
lol what did you think he had an angry face
your lab technician is flirting with you is this like after he broke up
did he ever flirt with you before
lol is this the first time
he knows you got a boyfriend though right
maybe it is nothinf but why are you bothered by your boyfriend i still donât understand
your boyfriendâs tenant
you should tell him that it is stupid to try to love someone by money
so will you tell him
lol are you satisfied with his tiny 20 year old dick
yes and bigger and fatter
lol thanks for being honest
you want to go back to you ex
i guess he did dump your ass
so you would want to go back
but i thougt you are also angry
he caused you to be depressed and last time you saw him you reacted hysterically
lol
right you want to see him suffer yoo too
ð
lol fuck him up girl
this is one of your character flaw you are absolutely hysterical
i just had a high class lunch with my motherâs friend in japan real fucking high class food french course lunch
i didnât pay because they invited me
i donât know i can still receive messages while i am not using it cuz i am always signed in i think each person costed like 9000 yen that is like 100

to be honest we probably wont
travelling as monks sounds good to me

it was good this relationship is gonna go slow or maybe i am just not aggressive enough i am pretty sure she likes me a lot and i like her a lot too
lol rly ok then goddamn i am fucking into her
yes i suggested to her that i would go visit her during summer but then she suggested that she would come visit me
nah i didnt she was kind of in a defensive posture i dont know if girls want their guys to be aggro but i didnt read any signs that she wants me to get intimate with her
ye
lol next time will be in fucking four months
unless she visits we spoke mostly in chinese
sorry english use chinese to say words that she doesnt understand i dont think i will fuck her she told me of an experience where she was molested before and that scared the shit out of her
yes i am serious about the molestation
that was my instinctual response but i know i am being hypocritical
ya
like i didnt realize what kind of girlfriend i wanted until i started dating this girl and i am now fucking glad i didnt date that other girl
ya
yes
she told me she fucking hated it and dont want to experience anything like that ever again the molester was someone who invited her out to drink what do you say son
i guess i gotta up that gent meter to the limit
gentlemen meter

oh ok how is the exam period now compared to undergrad you gotta go down hard
well good luck on it
it doesnt sound like med school is that difficult now that i hear about these info from uou you
ya
ya you need some injection of discipline knowing you
but discipline is a habit it is not something you can gain overnight just because you want it which makes it hard to gain ive been working on the text messaging story btw
i will write it out first it will ruin the impact of the reveal
if i tell you now
yo i am gonna leave now good luck on your tests and look forward to the story
later yo son i need to ask you for some serious advice man
yo nigger so my girl offered to let me sleep on the same bed with her when i go visit her and stay overnight but if you got any insight in this i would be interested in hearing it
my plan is to play it safe and respect her and sleep with her with a raging boner
probably 2 yo if you got any more stuffs to say write it down here but i gotta go take a shower now
oh hell but maybe if we dont bring condom maybe we are less inclined to fuck
alright thanks for your wisdom this wont happen for a while but it gives me time to think i am gonna shower now

sorry i was confused when i saw the questions i am chatting simultaneously with somebody else now
aright i am back yo you gotta read them text files i sent yiu
great stuff goddamn vegas was too damn hot my mother didnt like it even though she was the one who booked the trip
we visited red rock grand canyon thats it
whole family
we dont gamble we went for natural parks thats what most of our trips are for we are too weak to do shits like hiking or rock climbing
and too reserved for things like gambling
ya
we shoulda went to alaska where we had the opportunity to be killed by polar bear
ya i did in fact

when in late may i think i got time for some hang brb washroom
alright i am back yo nigger did you read them text files
thanks dude
ok hey nigger how is your ass doing yo nigger we need to plan for the hang yo negro have you ever talked about tina zhou in our conversations
ya did you ever go for her ass
lol she is too pro in what sense academically
i see
i dont know is she even single
wtf how is she fucking single she seems sociable and according to you is intelligent as well
ya you should go for her but only if you feel comfortable how is your ass doing in stratford you getting your desired amount of country side booties yo negro i gotta ask you a q negro
yo were you and tina frequently texting on fb she and i were texting earlier and i got this feeling that she was being very friendly to me maybe i shouldnt make a big deal out of this
ok then i will treat her like usual then thanks for the info yo negro have you seen sara abdullah these days i just saw her on the street
yes my man i am still in the kids
whenever i am ready to go home
yo i can join you but the script is taking some time to finish what are you planning on doing
ok when are you gonna do it
i actually have no idea this script is running slowly
alright what you people doing now son
yo after we parted ways i was reading some excerpts from the book i was talking about and damn did i have the biggest urge to recommend you that book
drive by daniel pink it will change your life man
give me some time
yo nigger i cant give you an excerpt because i cant copy and paste from kindle and i dont wanna type a paragraph but you just have to believe me when i say you need it
according to dweck people can hold two different views of their own intelligence those who have an entity theory believes that intelligence exists within usin a finite supply that we cannot increase those who subscribe to an incremental theory believe that while intelligence may vary slightly from person to person it is ultimately something that with effort we can increaseif you believe intelligence is a fixed quantity then every educational and professional encounter becomes a measure of how much you have if you believe intelligence is something you can increase then the same encounters become opportunities for growth in one view intelligence is something you demonstrate in the other its something you develop
this shit took me 15 minutes to type are you in chinois now
how is chinois any asian booties to be had in that area and ur ass is welcome
daaaaamn negros what do they do and where are they from
they spoke anglais you should give them a gift to remember you by ð it would make your parents happy to date an asian girl straight from our glorious homeland
why am i crazy
well that hook up culture do exist in china but definitely not as much as here in na but do they speak anglais though
well you should bring back that girl from chengdu not even kidding here you mentioned she is hot gotta show me a pic of her
give her something to remember you by thats how ð anyways yo i gotta go i need to leave early today for work to get ready for course selection
flirt with her show her your confidence dont be controlled by her beauty do not let her dazzling self affect your behavior think nothing of her but at the same time think everything of her
well lemme tell you i got the same problem but that is why we are both fucking anti social we care too much about how perfect we sound and because of that we lose confidence we get nervous
fuck those intellectual conversations thats useless in getting pussies what you wanna show through your language is not how grrm is a great author but that you wanna put your d in their hole
hope you get lucky with dat app why dont you take them up in their offer its a china prostitute
lol now wouldnt that make headline canadian medical student arrested in china for illegal sexual activities

yo nigger
well some time ago i had this shitty hp computer that broke down every year i sent it to repair until they finally couldnt fix it i didnt do anything to the laptop other than play lots of games

that is interesting i will look into it
well you know more than i do how is your ass in china making good impressions with people

well good luck i dont think you got any problems
sunday

ya but i drove there at night before aint a big deal
how late is it gonna be adelle cant play till like 7pm
yo can i crash at your place if i can then we can play longer and we definitely will be playing past 11pm if you want two full games
oh ya motherfucker
you got a guest room for me nigger oh shiet son thats no problem
i dont mind sleeping on the floor if you got like a sleeping bag ok lemme ask them
12am is the max for others
is the engineering building open during that time
7 to 12 is like 5 hours that is probably enough for two games last time we had 15 games in 35 hours
she gets off work at 6pm adelle came at like 130
and we left the library at 445 that was after moving to galvrauth galbraith
you guys need to come to my house on sunday really early
11am
and you cant play past 5pm
cuz i gotta leave
ok
adelle will probably come to galbraith at 7pm
alright
you are right yo adelle can only hang out until 11pm and she aint sure about sunday at the moment so this is a tough one
she will only have time for one game most likely and that is not what you want
i am not down for a third time nigger
that is just too much i dont feel like playing too much ur making my life revolve around the jong
we can play on friday night lets play our hearts out serious games
we are gonna play at the engineering building on friday 630pm
nope we gotta end at 11pm maybe at 12am if adelle is ok
yo nigger we playing mahjong tomorrow at 630 you cool with dat right

well i wont be there at 2pm i just want to stay in a room anyways i will see you later then i am gonna head out now talk to me via phone message from now on
dude i fucking told you so how the fuck did you guys meet
cmb
the fuck is that ohhhhhhh
lol she was looking for her boyfriend
well very soon i gotta cut off cuz i am with my girl she will be coming to my room soon if you dont mind her hearing our convo then we can do it
alright yo negrito i need ur help
yo i need ur help looking at my resume is that cool man just looking at grammar and spelling you sent an attachment
yo thanks man
negrito how are you doing
alright
yo lemme tell you
that there is a good chance that this winter i am gonna earn some 20  40  4  4 amount of money that comes to close to 12000 for this winter but also
right the thing is you will be missing a huge amount of the culture if you visit during christmas
because everywhere will be about christmas rather than japanese tradition except of traditional japanese inns or traditional japanese cities what will be mostly on display during winter will be christmas
japan is a heavily amercanized nation
for better or for worse yo nigger i just want to tell you the reality of the situation sorry i meant sure everywhere will be christmas but you can still eat your traditional japanese food
i might have time in august because i will be doing my summer courses and they end before early august so people can go on vacation
but if i seriously do end up earning that much money i will seriously not have that much concern about the financial component of the trip that is for sure but i still probably wont splurge like peter
if you want to see the sights early april is the best time that is when you can see the cherry blossoms but that is obviously not possible damn son japan during winter is a romantic season
i think if we try hard we can definitely find some excellent sights during winter
hmmm i think august is probably better i know for sure that i will start being available early august
did you already plan out your  summer
have you considered research oh wait you hated that stuff honestly what else can you do other than research during the summer shadowing becoming a better clinician
but like arent you gonna get plenty of shadowing experience during your training in med school hell you are gonna be clinicians in training
alright
the original recipe is the best motherfucker dont you go around changing that shit have you ever thought about doing anything you are passionate about outside of medicine the summer is a perfect opportunity to do that
ya for sure certainly cant chill at home i am glad that you got some plans outside of medicine yo negro how is your ass doing man
my nigger
how is med school today i found my coop placement
in a decent company
ciena is the company
they are the world leading provider of telecommunication equipments i am not exactly interested in what the company does but i get to develop a piece of software with them so that is going to be interesting
software developer anyways man coop is out of the way i am gonna make like 12000 from the coop gonna look forward to that shit
ya i made it happen
busted my nuts during the first year to make it happen i heard it is just average work hours but the schedule is flexible i will be starting in january
and end in april when did you expect me to start
i am gonna be in school during summer thats how i can take august off son
because school ends in early august
yes
you bet yo ass you do we gotta get peter kong involved on this too perhaps baoer if he is interested what do you feel about them niggers
yes we need to discuss this in more detail with those sons i feel that it is easier to have conversations when there are multiple people in the group
we can probably use him to counter balance peter kong i think i would be down to try some nice restaurants in japan once i earn some money so i might accompany peter to some fancy ass restaurants
we will discuss this in more detail with people
yes that is my idea maybe like twice per week max
yes it is buddy my last trip lasted almost three weeks and it costed around 3000 less than that probably
it is really the residence that is going to beat your wallet
and the plane tickets there are some cheap ones like ones that cost like 30 for one day that is about the cheapest you will find
ya the hostels in japan are high class
yes they are well timed but complex but also high quality
going to japan you dont need to worry about any kind of trivial shits but you gotta plan out your time well cuz they got tons of entertainment and places to visit
i can join you guys if i am still good with my girlfriend
but yo honestly after my time in my current relationship i dont have an appetite for sex no more if we are going to japan then she aint coming with us
i have no appetite sex is no longer as glamorous as i once thought it was
and knowing you you are probably feel the same shit when you go to a pinsaro and peter too so lets just drop that bullshit man
lol son how do you find them
lol what do you find to be crazy
ya japanese people are creative man thats how they make anime tentacle rape and shit
you should play mahjong against the locals though there are plenty of places in tokyo
some cheap places might make you lose 40 at most
lol
that is too bad
why is he interested
alright yo do you know this girl called chloe gui in western
she is in the schulich school
what is she doing there med student dent or graduate student
but she is in the main campus
haha gg son
we went to the mount sinai conference together back in summer of 2013 and she was sitting right next to me on the bus and she leaned on my shoulder when she was sleeping she is very social though
well i dont have a context to evaluate that intenseness cuz everything in medicine is easy if you try hard
yes she certainly did yo dude how is your ass doing in medicine is medical school beating your ass these days
what kind of feedback better grade
was that the only feedback
your class is filled with a bunch of slackers or what
well if they arent reading their case studies before hand then they are certainly slackers
those readings were supposed to be done as homework right
yo you should be proud of yourself for that shit man
test results and lectures aint the only way to learn
even if you dont do well on tests you are doing the right thing and that will certainly carry you forward in your medical career
i can guarantee you man think about when you are out of school and you are competing in a clinical setting those motherfuckers aint gonna look at lecture slides cuz there aint any
well they will
dude just maintain your attitude
you sent a photo yo nigger i heard you like girlâs revealing shoulder so i sent you the revealing shoulder of my girlfriend
whats fucked up
well the thing is she approved does that make it less fucked up i took this photo for you cuz you loved that shit
no but she doesnt care if i send this kind of picture to you why is that so hard to accept
i am in my residence reading week now
no i am in ottawa
no i got shits to do gonna finish off all academic shits then got to deal with external stuffs
organizing a game jam is a big one well i am gonna relax but that doesnt mean i am not gonna work how is your ass doing now
well aint that nice i am playing a lot of dota these days i wanna get my mmr up to 4k cuz dota is a fucking drug
ya that is a good point but i figured it is not bad to have one hobby that you are passionate about i call it a drug because i am pessimistic
lol now that is a good attitude
it is good to have fun in games but the only way to have fun in dota is to have good games and you cant get them half of the time beacuse people in your team are dumbass shits
anyways i am gonna play some now man i am on a winning streak with sniper
yo whats up nigger how is your ass doing
dude that is nothing but is the workload the same
does that change across the semester or somettjing
jesus man
i see hopefully you make it through your shit
yo i am messaging you cuz i need to discuss this with you i broke up with my girl this morning
cuz i cried many times today
well this was a long time coming i have been having a lot of problem being attracted to her to me she is just a hardworking person she doesnt amaze that much anymore amaze me
i have been suggesting it to her for a while now but it was her who came into my room and formally proposed it so that definitely catalyzed the breakup even though it might have eventually happened
they are surprised that my girlfriend didnt graduate from a good chinese university her behavior is not that of somebody who seems confident and happy and a whole bunch of shits that i actually feel are completely irrelevant to the relationship
it wouldnt have happened if i hadnt suggested to her so strongly objectively speaking i could have done things that would have improved the relationship like jogging swimming or playing games with her but it is too late now
maybe it was because i didnt put in any effort in the relationship there are times when i did have plenty of fun with her and those times i definitely loved her a lot
ya you are right
damn i was not expecting this shit ya sure thanks man
yo nigger what the hell is going on man i feel much better than the day of breakup now
what rhe fuck nugger you on reading week now
oh shiiiieeet
arenât you the good boy tell your mom that i said happy birthday we real tight you know
you can omit the second part but just tell her that frank wishes her a happy birthday or you meant the whole statement
lol you take this shit too seriously man
let her find it weird anyways yo tina zhou is coming over to ottawa for some health conference did you know that
no
she would be so incredibly happy ainât for sure yet
hahaha dude she is waifu material man
every family would want an out going wife and she is certainly one of those
how did your father imply that why arent you treating her nicely son she may be your future waifu
tell her what oh shit ya poppy i sure as hell aint
how does he know her
tina has that outgoing attitude about her that enchants everybody so i aint surprised that your father thought good shit about her
what indepdence
i think anybody could have done that given the opportunity
right i guess taht also factors into it my parents worships med school too they wont say bad shit about any girl from med school unlike what they did to my ex so anyways man
you aint gonna make that same mistake like you did with marina ya just fucking take that shit the next time it happens even if the relationship dont go smoothly you learn some shit
what kind of stability like financial like you gotta pay for her food that kind of shit
ya for sure man i will find out on my own
ya it would be nice there aint nobody like you guys around here in ottawa everybody are just gpa obsessed kids who dont realize what life can throw at them
nah yo son what did you think about talos principal principle
why is that
ya i noticed
but difficult does not mean brilliant
ya i can tell
it is like a poor mans portal
well i bought it today on sale
i bought a bunch of shits
i think this one was 10 at 75 off
lol 40 bucks for this even portal didnt cost that much i am surprised it even cost that much
but then again witness is around that much too anyways i bought a bunch of horror games because it is halloween sale
yes i do i havent finished it though
it feels quite boring actually
we should play it together next time do a run through you know
ya but from the puzzles i have played so far the game gets bored real quick
having interesting puzzles does not mean equally fun gaming experience and i think that a lot of these avantgarde game nowadays tend to forget that especially the witness
yes soma is definitely the one
dude if i want to play prey i might as well get the doom remake
i cant play it need windows
well i love horror where you have to run away from not the ones that i have to fuck with the horrors that i can shoot down are not called horrors like damn firewatch was fuckign awesome though
lol dude are you fucking asking me that shit i fucking recommended you that game ages ago that was another excellent game
aint for sure i might get it once it is available for mac
there needs to be some injection of creativity into the industry
were they magic players before
lol
is that similar to magic
what a fucking ripoff
didnt magic sue them for that shit or did they ever
oh ok
magic is the prototypical fantasy trading card game every trading card game ever made after that period was simplified from magic i feel like yugioh and duel master the former being incredibly popular so talk later
yo negro i may see you at western in november 1719
i am going for a hackathon attending these events really help you learn a lot of stuff and network and at the end of the weekend i might make a computer program that is incredible
ya thats right what is the bus ride to london from windsor i mean how is it
oh hell nooo where do you plan on staying at if you go to the magic tournament
i see well we probably wont meet then unless i decide to book a hotel room maybe the hackathon will provide lodging how are the girls at western though how fine are they
oh shieeet
haha yo i aint gonna try tinder or okc no more though i aint interested in hookup
after my last relationship no i dont well it is not my number 1 priority
maybe
lol son i was gonna talk with you today i dont have much stuffs going on in my life except i am studying procrastinating and learning about archviz
archviz is short for architectural visualization and i want to master it in unity the game development engine i want to make a game with scenes like this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv4q9ggom33ek
i want to make a game that takes place in a single beautfiully rendered room like this one you can have the player explore the characters life or solve some simple puzzles
but you do that all in one room so instead of exploring various locations i want to make a game that explores the life of the character escape room doesnt lend well to plot in my opinion
and speaking of escape room i am actually helping an escape room company develop a new vr escape room game
ya it is hard
i definitely have to look into that now i am curious
no they havent given me the vr equipment yet cuz we are still at the beginning stage of the development we are doing rough layout of the setting now
ya it is coop
ya so we basically have everybody in separate rooms but when you spawn in game you actually spawn close to each other
you have a controller that moves the in game character so you dont need to move but you can rotate your head to do the same thing as moving your mouse in fp games
nah you dont
yup
well at the moment they cost around the same maybe but it costs more because of the equipment that you need to set up but the appeal is in the vr do you got anything to say about that
how do those compare to the one in toronto
the one last year christmas we went to with the gay nothern people
for things that stand out
i dont know how much the vr escape rooms cost cuz they never told me
well i emailed a bunch of vr game developers in ottawa because i wanted to do coop in a game dev company this one was the only one that replied back to me
ya thats the only thing that i care about and it is not requiring any sort of commitment on me so
the people who i am going to be working with this winter said my msc stood out thats why they gave me first rank on coop but the person who said that
he did electrical engineering and then after several years he went back to school to do computer science
haha ya
but thats how i got my job at sickkids
yup
keep up the snow ball january 8th or some shit like that
in ottawa but it is like 2 hour commute for me everyday close to 3 hour
transit
my parents are considering giving me the car
certainly can just gotta be safe during snow days but i also need parking now and unfortunately the parking space around my house is full i gotta park on the street anyways son
goddamn son you sure are living the life
ya i know
waste as in procrasinate
well same here son the only social interaction i had this weekend was with my ex up stairs we just talked about some life shit i should hang out with people more
ya surprisingly good what do you do when you procrastinate
pubg
no
the fuck is that shit a pc game
oh right you watch that shit why dont you get a new mac or even a new windows laptop
lol would love to see a well accomplished doctor sitting in a sweaty and smelly room in 401 games playing magic with plumbers and highschool dropouts
magic is a very social game man that requires more dedication than games like chess and dota
my point being taht i would be uncomfortable to spend time  playing with strangers when i should be taking care of family i think it will take some time for me to settle down at this rate
damn son your nostalgia is strong
same here we are like brothers the best buddy i got but who the fuck knows what i am gonna be doing in the future i might go live in vancouver toronto is a good choice
you mean living in toronto
who the fuck knows man we will make the decision that is most suitable for us given our situation and i think we will be happy with them even if we dont get our dream
i mean hell i was hoping all my life that i get to live in tokyo and maybe even settle down there but situations might not allow it yo i want to know
dude every tine i think about you i think about things would have went differently if you dated that party girl like damn nigger that was a golden opportunity in my opinion and intelligence goes a long way
i was always of the opinion that you lost a decent chance regardless of how we rationalized the end result
ya what is done is done
by the way you mentioned that you guys had a wonderful chat on coffee and bagel but what exactly did you guys talk about
lol comon son
i am actually curious about your conversation because that gives me an idea of what you consider to be a good conversation
lol so there are a lot of girls who came to canada after they are 18 on cmb i mean but anyways if she grew up here then she would most definitely have a high level of english skill
maybe i should get back into some of that tinder and cmb action
what makes you say that i would be successful on cmb
i feel that you have to make your profile look good too it isnt just about education
haha ya i did i will try it out one of these days but only cmb yo nigger i set up my cmb my pictures are vastly different from befofe
well i can but i wanted to tell you that i think i am lacking motivation to start a serious relationship now because of my last relationship
talk later son i gotta eat yo nigger i am back but you know i will play around with cmb gonna make some friends
well extremely well it was only the first day when i interact with her now we dont have any physical intimacy but i am very casual with her
i dont think that would have been a huge problem for me because i make things very casual in all of my close interactions she wouldnt have had no beef with me yo does cmb work on internet
oh right there are some nice girls on cmb in my area
but so far i only liked 3 since yesterday lol how the fuck
maybe because they find you unatttractive ooooohhhhhhh gg
ya well you can smile more to compensate
you gotta show me some screen shots i am curious
what is your hottest match right now
lol how do you keep getting these med students to be fair i got two myself actually i dont know hwo to fucking take screen shots on my iphone you sent a photo
well there are a lot of fat white girls and not many asian
they gotta date their own kinds
how the fuck are you getting those did yo uset it to toronto
how do you do that
wait do you mean you change it in the profile or in the setting of the app
i dont see it son
you sent a photo so which is it profile or setting view and edit profile
there aint nothing son ok i just changed hopefully i get more matches this time around but how do you deal with those matches who wanna have a piece of action with you
well ainât that sweet of you
of course i am just fucking with you man dont worry about it but damn son exciting opportunities on cmb yo you still ahvent told me your opinion of that girl i showed you earlier
ya
she said she is just a student at uottawa 23 or something 22
aint nothing i can see
who knows man
she is a sporty girl
nah she probably wont she is just pretty is all and my ex just saw my cmb lol that was fucking awkward at first but then we joked around about hooking up with people
i had it on my phone she walked in my room when my phone was still on
she knocked actually but i forgot my phone was on and it had the cmb stuffs on it i am just careless
ya man i was so surprised with this shit yo how are the girls in your class doing are they still all in relationships aint nobody broke up or anything
props to them it takes a lot of effort to maintain a long term relationship at this young age
i sometimes think to myself i gotta use my time for wisely instead of watching youtube videos all day
perhaps but thats not how i see it i prefer to see everybody around me being superior to me so it makes me feel bad enough to try harder in my life i am gonna get back to work
later buddy lol dude your crush michelle is on cmb toronto
yes have you ever encountered her before on cmb that is
i did nigger i will catch her before you do if you donât hurry
damn shame for you then better watch your ass nigger
i am gonna swipe right to all your crushes
dude i am trolling your ass man donât take this that setiously
i highly doubt i will encounter any other of your former crushes
you sent a photo yo this is michelleâs description on cmb she likes career driven people man
not really just thought you might be interested in some way though i am surprised that she wants a career driven boyfriend but i thought she was more open minded than that
they want a boyfriend with ambition
but they havenât considered how it actually works in a real relationship though lol so they can stay at home and take care of kids
you mean girls who came to canada late or girls who grew up here but with mainland heritage
well we are talking about michelle here
like what
that is harsh
but dude i am pointing to the fact that michelle has this weird mindset for somebody who assumed to be mature and intelligent we assumed
like i donât think she wants to marry into money
lol dude you are gonna make big money just wait for another 7 years
dude i am saying she probably mentioned that shit about career cuz somebody of her intelligence and high social standing deserves a partner who is strong and ambitious
it is an immature mindset though wonât you agree
i believe it is they donât understand how a relationship works yo nigger i am gonna swtich places
all i got to say is she doesnât know how a relationship works anyways brb nigger
haha nigger dude she aint got no need for money cuz she can make them herselves money grows on tree for her man
and dude i can make more money than you if i try hard enough
well i donât work for money but i am just saying i can make it happen if i try
i ainât motivated now to do that
i actually got so much shit to say about this situation especially since this happened in my home town and regarding the content of the article this might never happen in west because communication is not deficient here httpswwwtheatlanticcommagazinearchive201709howamericalostitsmind534231
i dont think i admitted that i outright will have a hard time living there i did say that the magic of japan being my ideal country will dwindle as time goes without knowing about my japanese background
facial hair i donât have none but anyways man the ethicness of this practice it is basically feeding more and more lies into the system so i want to know what moral high ground you are standing on
the fuck kind of facial hair is that
lol
i didnât know i thought they taught you guys to be degenerate fucking liars so it is a surprise to hear that they dont so you gotta tell them straight up then huh but anyways son
so there is a level of sugarcoating is it not maybe not sugarcoating
but a level of manipulation of perception
it is ok to manipulate somebodys perception of an event but it is not ok to provide facts taht are incorrect
well i find neither one of those ethically right to be honest i just tell it to them straight up and in fact i dislike people who actually dont give the information straight up i just want the truth
well in retrospect anytime somebody tells me a bad news straight up i have no regret in hearing them so there is that difference when we evaluate the ethicness of that practice in japan
give it to me son
i will brb taking care of my food but write them down
is there anything else you say
i dont have a problem with that because you are still telling them the truth
but like that is not what i have a problem with
well i have seen fair share of people in not necessarily in medicine but biomedical research lie or manage perception in different ways
i am not blaming the institutions i just dont find it that remarkable as you that somebody is making a living out of lying to people and this was done in a professional setting
not really i wasnt super mad i just felt like well they have gone to the next level i suppose you did
well do you condemn them for operating such a business because the business itself is questionable at best sorry questionable at worst
i see you gotta ask your parents whether they were hired actors lol
yo i have been using cmb for one whole goddamn week but nothing has happened
alright i will give it time but there are some amazing girls in toronto
did you set some kind of preferance that might have disabled her
nah actually it is incredibly smart design by the people from cmb it is the design that help them make the most money
like if i swipe right for every girl on my recommendation i can guarantee you that none of them actually swiped me right i tried this once before i believe on cmb and tinder
yo negro i wanna ask you something what is the difference between sales people and the lying actors from japan for you sales people also utilizes psychological and communication tricks to manipulate peopleâs perception
canât they just look more into the matter which is what they actually should be doing maybe not in the case of children because they are too young to know better i mean where lying wonât work
well all i really wanted was to poke hole in your argument because that argument about being lied to believing is not a choice lies on some ground that seem to me a it shaky and i wanted you to expand on it but you obviously aint gonna change your mind on it
lol you just told me i am wrong and then repeated the same shit you said before
i started this whole discussion because you condemn those actors but to me that doesnt seem different from any other salesman out there they are also all fucking actors and they dont give a shit about what happens to their client the end results might be different in scale although i believe that is arguable but ultimately they are all doing the same action of lying to people and people in both businesses make effort to be good at what they do
yo nigger i am coming down to your town today
london i guess technically that ainât your town
lol nigger you on reading week break
oh i see how are you going back
tina zhou
andrew lechman that son of a gun yo negro how is life going for you man did you enjoy your time in toronto
it was fucking fun goddamn son
that is nice who are you buds
the guy who is a teacher now
that son of a gun
are you in touch with stefano i didnt check out the city so i didnt have much to say dont have much to say aabout the city
the nigger stefano
oh really you keep ni touch with people son thats good there was this one girl in the hackathon that we sorted of started talking a lot with perhaps she was just friendly
httpswwwfacebookcomprofilephpid100010019087723refbrtf this is her profile son she originally chatted with me cuz i posted a sample of my work in the hackathon common chat but we kept in contact throughtout the event
httpsdevpostcomsoftwarepocketpup this is what i made she looks good yes but i dont know how i wanna deal with this girl in the future in the meantime i will just be friendly with her
ya man but online friend seems fine right
ya not my original idea i wanted to just make a straight forward survival horror game
lol hell no man the prizes were won by people who werent so obsessed with winning like for starters i wanted to make a first person game then this guy wanted to participate in the weather data prize
he came up with the pet idea no he is a cool guy dont let his appearance deceive you
lol i didnt bother reading his description
lol dude you are readinug my portion not his description i did the motherfucking hardest part
so i am an asshole now huh
hahaha that is fine by me
we met on the hackathon common chat
ya but these are all really cool guys
yes
for around 27 hours we worked together
i slept for 9 hours between friday night and sunday morning 4 hours on friday night and 5 hours on saturday night
ya but we got stuffs done and i learned a new technical skill yup thats right nigger you would never find these kinds of shits in medicine or in other fields of engineering
oh ya
one per year
dude i am gonna be attending like 3 or 4 of these at least every year
i am not actually going for business connections they are more like chess tournaments to me a place to focus and improve my skill but business connections will probably arise eventually
i came down to the conclusion recently that i think my life is about focusing on improving my own technical strength it is fucking hard to change myself to be more social it is not hard to find employers
of course
i possess that
but to be fair with you man i have seen employers turn against people who are sociable and friendly when they cant do their jobs properly it has happened to me it has happened to the people around me
and focusing on improving my skill will go a long way to getting results
i think that is a management style that leads to the demise of a company lets clarify something here in what situation would you discard me
i will find out this coming coop term if that is true the only time that i would fire somebody is if they disrupt the flow of the company
alright buddy yo i want to describe that girl in more detail and i want to know your opinion and this was like within an hour of our first conversation
but she aint that type of girl she was totally polite and seemed innocent when i was observing her irl and she was conservative i guess simply put she seemd shy
right
i am saying she seemed like she wanted the d but i know from experience that i am usually wrong so i want to analyze this situation with my tight brother
in the end i didnt take up the offer
i have no clue
shower
dont worry about it man just wanted some nice chat with my close g
dec 20th we gonna do crazy shit when i come back
just asking man maybe we can do a snow fight at deer park deerp park public shcool
ya is there a lot of snow in toronto
ok
hopefully lots of snow when i come back
yes yes i got it
you will get more christmases in your life buddy i will go celebrate in your hospital ward every year from now
well i actually thought it would be pretty fun if it did
you fucking serious son i feel like you are overexaggerating
there is no way that is going to be true i see people getting off during christmas all the fucking time from my past labboratories anyways son i am gonna sign off too fucking sleepy now
good night son and sleep easy dude you need to check this out bbut i suspect you might already have heard about this httpswwwgamasutracomblogsandywallace20171122310166urzasdreamenginetheroborosewaterrobodraftcreatingamachinelearningalgorithmtoillustratemagiccardsphp
ya the names were nonsensical and the arts  were also ambiguous too but it was cool to me since i will eventually be dealing with machine learning myself
and dudde i aint getting no pussy on cmb i get like 21 suggestions every fucking day and i have been diligently swiping their asses for like the entire month and nothing
not matching
mostly asian
toronto
i think so
funny thing is though cmb indicated that two of the girls liked me but htey were both ugly like damn son
no i passed their asses to other desperate men
like cmb literally indicated that they liked me
when you are looking through them they tell you
lol ugly girls
you know i am son what do you unlock when you pay for this
haha dude why dont you just fucking tell her you wanna fuck
well even if you did pay you wouldnt actually be able to do anything about her other than stalking her stats they are just tempting you paying only serves to ease your lack of awareness
not a good time to go on cmbb but she is there waiting for her prince are about
sorry i actually dont really know what that contradiction leads to but it certainly makes the dating game at the initial stage very confusing
like the thing that needs to get across is that the other party is putting effort in you and you bbecome less hesitant in offering yourself to the other once that is known ya thats right
ya that is the one thing about relationship that people have misconception about they think they can win but not really because you will put a lot of effort in it but retaining the relationship itself leads to happiness
forget about it it depends on perspective
lol that is an awesome mother who does she got on her list
yo actually my mother said the same thing before but i also refused them because i want to avoid the awkwardness that is a very important psychological factor for me
unless i am going to a night club i aint going to forcefully ask for a date
lol why dont you ask her to prove it show you some pics tell her about your preferences for big ta
haha yo i am gonna go wash some rice but write down whatever else you got in your mind
it would be nice if the app really saved you but in the end i feel like the type of girls that we will be happy with are not gonna be found on cmb
i feel like we will have higher chance of finding a good girl irl than in cmb
yo who are the girls you have a crush irl
physically attractive you mean
how much about them do you know personally
i see i am confused at the concept of attraction thats why i was asking you those questions i dont know when is a good time to go for girls
i know what failed when girls be nice to you it doesnt mean she wants your dick
i have always been confused at how you are unable to get a girl so far like you have way more supplies of girls than i have cuz i dont interact with many people
answering that question correctly can help you with your life in general not just with girls
well i have a few hypothesis the big one is being picky another one is not opening yourself up to intimacy
i mean you have high standard for your girl right you need someone who is intelligent you need somebody who is in a high class career path and you need somebody who is lowkey as you
ya thats right man we are who we are it is hard to change ourselves but dude like i realized this recently but a relationship aint about judging on our partners status
ya that place is a shit hole
toronto and vancouver are the best places
i am gonna sign off for now to have dinner and work buddy i am gonna catch up with your ass later
yo nigger got my first match on cmb a western law graduate yes
why not son is it landing you all the uglies to be fair this match is also average in looks
ya that is certainly true i experienced that too in the past but maybe you can change up your tactic in chatting like being more unpredictable about your topic that will show the girls uncensored response
yo maybe we can analyze how tina talks to people she is like one of those girls that for whatever reason i didnt feel bored talking to when we started interacting
what did she say
hmm that is true
lol
ya that is certainly true
lol that is true too but michelle uses cmb what do you got to say about that
so there are some possibilities
it is hard to find high class people but that is why you pass them
i mean there will always be difficulty when you are trying to achieve things with higher standard than average so that is just the kind of life we should expect in ourselves expect to live
i am curious what kind of people are tina unwilling to deal with i thought she was a benevolent human being
would you consider them lower class
lol you have seen her anger but yo i thought like majority of medical students have very mainstream interests in music
man i love me some girls going crazay
she went crazy over utterly illogical reasons but i want my girlfriend to beat me up if i do stupid shits that are truly stupid you know what i mean
haha you know i am fucked up to the core anyways son cmb a platform for compromise
ya they want you to leave all those behind son
you said you didnt have any hot matches now you are saying they were hot the fuck is going on here nigger
you should ahve shown them to me son i was curious as fuck
you will see her one day and you then you can like her lol imagine her face when she see you on cmb sorry her reaction
thats not gonna help with anything yo i am gonna sign off to work now will chat with you later man enjoy the rest of your day
hello son how are you doing
oh ya like what
i am chilling so hard these days exams dont mean nothing to me i am working on my last assignment of the term and after that i am gonna study yo check this out httpsinthevalleyofgodscom
in 2019 but that is probably gonna be delayed honestly good games take a long time to be made and this one is looking like a good one and they are making it for mac too
well it has been two years since firewatch came out they probbably too like a four month break or something and went right back to work but anyways real close to winter break when are you back in toronto
this upcoming friday i aint coming back till like 20th
oh hell no son that is still more than two weeks though
good amount of time
what kind of works do you got long term assignment
ya you better make good use of your time i am gonna try that too even though i dont really have much plans for the winter break in terms of meeting up with people
ya that is pushing it
schools typically end in early august we might have just one week for the travel and honestly that might just be ok
that is also a good idea where do you plan on going
if you start school on 20th when do you want to be back to canada by
we then got around 57 days which is honestly still ok
lemme check well officially courses take the entire duration of summer but people has been telling me that summer courses typically end early lets just say that we are going to japan and nothing will stop us
damn we gotta plan this shit out real hard then i will go talk to the profs who i will be dealing with during the summer to see when the classes end
ok that is definitely taken care of so we should plan then lets talk about this after we finish our works for this term
ya i aint got nothing to do
you sure love that shit
we need to go to a good place in tokyo
you will at most lose like 40 bucks
but like40 bucks is in the same ball park as visiting a famous sight i mean it is around 10  20 but that is in the same ball park of 40
why dont you just think of it as experiencing the culture
not all of them there are free ones where you just walk in but for example visiting the tokyo tower costs money
lol ok
you can do whatever son you also wanna bring peter along it would be cool if he can come as well but i have no idea what his schedule is like
well we kind of have to bring him along because he is one of the three negros from china
well we will talk with him about it and come to a compromise
we will definitely talk about this together like gs if nothing can be done then we will have to make a decision
yo whats up son i am back next wednesday
i am arriving on wednesday and i will stay in courtice for the night
ok i will see what i can do yo uwant to play with the same old people
i dont know any exciting people who knows how to play lol
philip is talkative
do you know anybody
we should probably stick with adelle i prefer to play serious games than games where people chat what is your constraint on time
when are you leaving
i think i will ask some people around to see if anybody other than adelle is available
ok i will ask her then
yo do you have any suggestions for places in toronto where we can find good table to play the libraries are going to be closed during winter holiday right
i actually fucking hate those chairs
i once played in one of those fancy rooms where they had this perfectly sized table near college station it wasnt really fancy but it was a small room with excellent tables and chairs for mahjong and nothing more
no i wasnt playing with you guys it was in one of those buildings on the south side of carlton street there are a lot of office suites in that area
that is not on carlton dude and no way would people from mars let us play mahjong in that building lol that is a place of productivity not entertainment
so both of my contacts already replied back one of them cant play until 28th
you canât play on the 28
lol you thirsty as fuck
i made a post on facebook looking for a potential 3rd or 4th
how is toronto right now son
bet you have been eating shit all this time in windsor
ya mine is as well i am looking forward to some home cooking did you exchange gifts with the people from you class
i was glancing over them and i didnt see your photo
do you just exchange random gifts or is it designated as in who receives whose gift and some of the girls in the pic look nice especially tina like damn son
you sure about taht son
lol tf is this shit why cant you tell me now
is this an interesting long story
well you now got me curious i cnat wait to get back son and just to let you know i contacted some people on reddit who might want to play mahjong
lol what you dont wanna play with new people
why not
i see
well troller gonna troll but since you insist we can get bao then but we can also get black stefan he used to play mahjong and he will play better than bao
he came back to toronto did he not or he went back there again
no dude he was staying here for the long term he finished his program in california and broke up with his girl so he had no reason to stay in cali
yes i fucking am
yes it sure has son but you gonna call up the nigger last time i accidentally called him a nigger and he might have been offended
well like i said it happened by accident i mistook him with stefan zivkovic
when stefan bhagwandin sent a message to remind me to renew his contact number he only said stefan and i didnât realize it was the black stefan so i made an assumption an instinctual assumption
i donât understand why you find it funny it was just an unfortunate situation
i believe i changed stefanâs contact number but yesterday when i sent that number a message the person told me i got the wrong number which seemed weird because i remember changing to the correct new number
lol i want to see the look on his nigger face when he sees me
lol nothing to me but i think he is purposefully ignoring me after my statement so i want to see his reaction to meeting someone he is ignoring when he no longer can ignore me no more
meng and i are on good terms but if you are going to invite black stefan one day do not let him know i am also coming
oh so you wont invite him unless you are playing maj
talking about life is cool too you are gonna have some silent moments but those are normal
well because in the past you thought of him as somebody who didnt dedicate effort into things maybe that is one reason
but i think there are other things that you guys have common interest in other than life values you can probably do the same if you dont focus too much on that aspect of his life
yo letâs plan to play on thursday nignt adelle canât play during the day because she doesnât get a break
yes yo i am going to leave meng baoâs invitation for you to take care of for thursday mahj of course
well you take care of it since you want to play this shit i am only responsible for adelle and the board if you donât trust him then tell him that we will invite somebody else
ya sure m2h2j4
64724299878
6472429878 the second one is the ocrrect one
ya you can use broodstarfrankhotmailcom
lol why the fuck
government dont give a shit if it is professional email at least i dont think they do but you can also use fwang100uottawaca that one will last me for the next 3 years or so
i have no fucking clue man other people also have like numbers after their names but frank wang is not a terribly unique name neither is stanley li
ya
630pm location yet to be determined
i dont know of a valid place other than the engineering building
lol my house
it might take adelle some time to get to my house
they dont care even if they are home but unlikely
downtown if we are going to invite adelle unless you wanna get someone who can start early
and 630 is the time chosen because adelle gets off work at 6pm
you wanna get somebody else
to be fair meng bao is a n00b too and i sure dont like playing with n00bs
ya that is slightly untolerable for me i cant enjoy the feeling of fully crushing somebody if one player is a n00b
ok so tentatively the location of our meeting will be at the engineering building do they even open during holiday
that place was fucking cold though for some reason like it was cold during a fucking summer i wonder why
ya i will nigger robarts library is open until 11pm tomorrow we can play there man
ya
well this is your event son you do whatever is necessary
if he shows up late we will just wait
yo you need to harass meng bao now to make sure he is coming on time yo wtf is going on with meng bap did he reply
ok i will be slightly late to get food
really ok letâs go to sf
just did she is aware
lol i am playing it now i downloaded it just a few days ago it takes a long time and you have to sit through boring txt and dude you still havenât given me any interesting details about tina
ya
i mean we can just do what we always do go to dinner and before that go walk around and talk
well you dont like talking anywhere that is not very private and my house is one of the few places that we can talk privately so i guess my house
downtown
maybe my father but my mother will not be around
finch
well we can joy ride
you just wear a lot man i have no clue i dont know of any good restaurants nearby we can check around yo you need to tell me more detail about that tina story
its not like i like her or anything ok
lol
yes
idiot in japanese
ok
merry christmas nigger yes supposedly what did you want to do again this time we also need to discuss plans for the trip
the nigga ride meng bao wants to play mahjong seriously do you want to play again on thursday
ok nigger howâs ur ass in windzor
you arenât arrested from having your child pornography discovered on your laptop
i see well there ainât no shortage of porn online so you ainât got nothing to worry about
torontoâs humidity has been absolutely horrendous and my eczema is acting up again as a result
i am getting the fuck out of here tomorrow no torontoâs humidity
well i have been doing nothing but working on my game for the past few days and playing games and watching youtube i gotta get back into shape in my new workplace she is actually good looking
negative sir leaving tomorrow
ego stroking is what it is
but maybe online chats will get us somewhere i have been chatting with my first match and we are having great conversations but too bad i donât find her that physically attractive
thanks buddy but honestly toronto ainât fine man i am thinking about living in vancouver now after experiencing this horrible winter you mentioned you wanted to go there too so maybe we will meet our fate together there someday
it is not just the cold i have eczema all over my body when the surrounding gets really dry
do you use cream
do you get dry skin on your hand though
how the fuck does your sister get eczema she rub herself all day
rubbing of your skin it doesnât show up until bad humidity though but it is retroactive rubbing that happened in the summer can lead to eczema during winter
i am speakjng from experience anyways iam gonna try some skin care product if i can cuz this shit is driving me insane
later nigger whats up
go ham dude ainât nothing can be done
well the kid explaining his way out of the situation was cringey and the mothers reaction was not impressive but the comments are funny thats the only thing funny about the lnk link
you bet your ass you are son
gonna have to hit some of those red light district i tell ya
yo i might meet you guys in japan during the summer there is that possibility i just had a phone conversation with the coop program director and there are still some open summer applications
i might
later boy yo nigger how did your test go
you already know
lol she is a real homes
dude people do things by the books because they dont want to get yelled at when they make mistakes it aint nobodys natural state to be professional
why didnt you prepare earlier man you wouldnt have had to go through this shit
25 years old and still has to crunch for exams can you believe that shit
ya ya i know to be honest i might have procrastinated too if i were you medicine is a real boring subject when you have to memorize shits on a piece of paper
could be
well i hope in the future they can solve that problem because curriculums are suffering now because everybody is doing the same boring shits for the sake of organization
people will solve that eventually i think 20 years down the line our kids wont have to deal with that bullshit no more
thats great
at least people are trying
lets hope really different anyways man
oh shiiiiiieeeet ok
ya you better go jerk that chicken in the shower son its good for you
do you guys jerk it together
wait what why are you talking about big ass
how do you have a female roommate
and i still dont get why you suddenly brought up the big ass
lol ok maybe you can do more than jerk if you ask nicely like two old blokes
whatever man
some
i actually have no clue dude i know how to say it in japanese
oh dont you worry son i got dat covered
you can actually learn it from kill bill remember that scene where that japanese salary man was drinking with that crazy girl
well the girl asked the dude whether he wants to do it yaritai thats all you got to say man boku to issho ni yaru anyways yo i am gonna sleep too actually
hope you use pages man you sent an attachment
ok you sent an attachment here it is good buddy
alright i will probably be asleep by then
fwang100uottawaca
thanks bud dude you should become my personal editor this new version sounds like a millions times better than the old one
ya you bet your ass you helped me this stuff makes a difference what are you up to today
is that gonna be expensive you can probably go over there and get some head from the gypsy girls that would be an unique experience
like in ur class or just in general people in the same program
i am envious of your close knit community people in my class are all scattered
lol well i donât take advantage of those
but yes there are some good looking girls out here who are white ya it is all about that dream ainât it
thatâs like me going to japan i am probably going to fantasize about jap girls but i ainât gonna hit on them or nothing introverts like us have it rough man
lol that is possible
i am hoping though that i get good connection with one of the execs and they would let me marry their daughher
that is a stronger fantasy in my mind
well that is not my objective but i love myself some high class girls or rather it is just an easy way to get a girl than going on the street
ya i wonât but i am hoping to make friends with the people there hopefully it is easier in japan than in canada one of their favorite catchphrase is âwow thatâs so amazingâ
interpret what like japanese mentality makes them very selfaware and i think that makes them have weak social presence and yo i was chatting with tina on friday she seemed like real drained or some shit
lol
i see she actually mentioned when we were chatting that she was considering texting me on thursday but then our conversation was kind of weak since she was too sleepy goddamn that girls drives me crazy
ya i wonât i just got way too much free time on my hand when you have lots of free time you over analyze these small things when are you leaving for dim sum by the way
oh i see
nope
ok what is fun about it
i cant play the game cuz it is windows only damn shame son
no man i should have kept it but i uninstalled windows partition on it and that laptop is now in toronto one of these days i should add windows on that laptop
i ddnt i watched somebody else play it
i got the general gist of gorogoa though
i didnt finish watching
good for you son these days i feel games like this are legit good entertainment in the old days we would only ahve tv shows
hmmm maybe maybe we just werent exposed to this sphere in the old days we mostly played big games like magic and dota
i meant we were playing competitively that we didnt notice all these great indie games
ya and valve stopped making great games damn fucking shame but anyways i hope you enjoy gorogoa let me know how you find it
yo nigger how is your ass doing man
not pussy
on paper i should have plenty of spare time but i am busy with things outside of work and hobby i have to help organize my schools game jam as part of the exec mostly studying
monday evening and wednesday evening yo you aint gonna believe my ass for saying this but i find this middle aged lady in my work place incredibly attractive
this person is a married indian lady who is about as white washed as it gets
yo i aint gonna do jackshit i am just appreciating her attractiveness
ya they will skype i am feeling relaxed but i want to do some reading to feel more comfortable it is the type of interview that will rely heavily on my personality and confidence rather than my skill
but i mentioned it clearly in the cover letter that i am down to learning it
i know the high level concepts i guess the best i can do is just spend the whole sunday studying
i mean cant i relax while i am studying nah i am cool with interviews
relaxation depends heavily on your perception of the event ahead of you in my opinion it is not the things that you do to prepare for it that dictates relaxation which i am full of confidence of
i heard they dont actually care that much about japanese because they mostly will speak english but they appreciate any level of japanese that you can speak
thanks yo
ya that is the plan it is actually better i go in september than in may precisely for that reason
i would also like to spend the winter in japan instead of in canada so i can avoid this shit weather that is the added benefit of going to japan in fall
alright man i am gonna sign off for the night have fun memorizing body parts
dude i just found out about a game called the station it is availabble for mac it could be very interesting
httpswwwfacebookcomthestationgame
the dude made it in 7 fucking years
i dont doubt it man did you find the puzzles challenging but doable
i wish i had my other computer with me i would have installed windows and played some windows game like gorogoa on it how is life by the way are you resting on a friday night
lol are you playing in a grand prix in a fucking strangers motherfucking car
cool glad to see you doing the things you enjoy gonna be a fun weekend for you
that is a really sweet card board
how much is it
is that like a dual land or some shit
ya sounded about right so how are you doing with that game nowadays
man that sounds like fun i might have stayed in the game if modern was as popular when i quit
well i got more important hobbies now
i donât see the fun in pauper when you cannot play overpowered cards
what op common cards are there
honestly that doesnât sound very fun
well you know stanley i focus on a different kind of skill nowadays i donât put that much energy in competition anymore and i donât want to put that much energy in competition
well i am so sorry dear buddy for disappointing you
i think you just need to accept that i am a very different personality compared to a lot of people including you when it comes to enjoyment
i need to spend too much money and it will take forever for me to get accustomed to the large card pool
and i made a vow to myself to not dedicate my time to games that i would play competitivelu
you are a bro for considering that stanley
but truth be told it would be wasted on me
haha possibly man we might have made a great team coming up with new decks i know past players had teams that come up with new deck ideas
5cc was one of them
what kind of decks have you made so far were they for legacy
when i played magic the last time it honestly felt like the different deck archtypes had largely locked on their ideal set of cards tinkering with variations doesnât sound very interesting honestly
dude have you ever fucking heard about deepfakes that shit is out of this world dude technology is taking us to heaven
this dude called deepfake on reddit got banned for making porn where he used machine learning to swap the face of pornstar with the face of a celebrity and they look pretty damn real
ya cuz it aint real heaven aint real but it is bliss people are looking for and thats what they are gonna get
like my whole reaction to this event is nothing but laughter this is why i am gonna learn ml lol so i can face swap my crush with a pornstar
hahha ya it is but aint nobody gonna stop me
hahaha that is very kind of you how is magic at toronto
well have fun son
yo nigger are you on break today
ya i know
how is your ass doing son ya i am in toronto
busy with pussies
damn shame even on a break day is this how it is going to be like as a doctor for your entire life always busy and stressed
i aint up to much i am debbugging my game and just overall relax havent chatted up with tina in a while maybe i will do so sometime this weekend
did you have much time to relax over the past few weeks
oh right sounds like some tough times for you i aint gonna bother you then have fun with work
ya for sure the same usual controversial convos ya you dont wanna get peter involved
ok
yo nigger you are not gonna believe what i did last night
nah nigger i spent an hour digging up an old magic pro tour archive and reading its live coverage pro tour hollywood 2008 it was the debut tournament for the 5cc
i dont remember luis but i primarily read it for the wafo tapa he inspired me to play the control and it was his games that i read about
nah i aint man but it is good to hear that he is still active in the scene yo any update on what you might be doing for summer
is it decided yet you doing the observership or what is your timeline in detail i can still go to japan but that will depend on when we are going
dont worry about it just let me know as soon as possible though and try to make a condition to open your late july and early august free when you get a position
my best time is ideally between july 23rd to august 6  2 days 23rd is the day all my classes finish then we can go to town on 24 or 25th
yo nigger nigger you need to talk to me now son
yo man you remember alice zhang who i dated back in summer of end of third year
oh yes she did i had this lingering feeling that she got a boyfriend cuz she stopped talking to me like after i started working at sickkids you dig what im saying
ya i think we had a similar conversation before last time we talked about how connie zhang either got married or engaged like a year or two ago you remember the girl ya basically the same shit
also today is proof that when a girl stops talking to you that means she got someone
it is pretty damn good proof son
ok yes
evidence in support but it is an incredibly strong evidence
lol you are making me lol for real son
jesus brings me back to the old times
yours didnt sound like a hell honestly
what part of it was hell that you were doing work that you didnt like
how did it change you though we never really talked about this in detai
the only thing we said was it makes a nigger out of all of us
the master program that is
but how did that change you though
nah dude it is reality but you just never had the opportunity to do it
and the professors are not good at nurturing students
who were managing you to do all those work though
you had the chance to do the project the way you wanted to do it which could have had a healthy balance between analyzing papers and theory crafting and doing laboratory work
ya i get you man
i was like that too if i go back again and do it will be a different story but that wasnt until i was encouraged from doing nonscientific work that i realized what i am capable of
seems like you have it tough son
oh ok damn how was it
maybe she loved that about you is this still on coffee meets bagel
jesus well you at least tried
what was she like on cmb though i am curious
always worth a shot
oh cool
is she hot
yo i found out about that too and it surprised me when it did
like i thought for sure that i was some guy who loved this shit but this past weekend i did that with my father and it wasnt all that invigorating
ah i see
like what kind of intellectual stuff is this philosophical
how do you even brings those kinds of heavy stuffs up in your first date though
that sounds more like you are analyzing the other person
well you will recover tonight
dude you havent answer how hot she is
i did son
scroll up and check
aint a thang
lemme tell you you dont need big tits
hezus his photos show him as a buff man so my conclusion upon seeing that was there are a lot of girls who dig surface level attraction if you want more girls on cmb maybe you should work out
ya he was white i am actually going to do that this summer hopefully i wont give up mid way
hmm that is also true but i am going to go to japan very soon
you are ok with dating someone who you dont find that attractive i thought you wanted all the hot girls
well you can you just gotta try
nah man you can try and keep trying till you succeed
i believe you can son but you have started late and it is not worth your time to try it
you have a huge disadvantage but it is not 100 impossible
well if you want it badly enough then it is not foolish to aim for it
oh ya
i will look into it
thanks for sharing man i will look into it
for sure son yo
haha it was from a coop excellence celebration
there was this event where they invited coop students
it is all coop students man i aint nobody special
haha thanks do you think i slouched too much though
i gotta work on that
i am not very proud of this photo but i put it as a display because it is so hilariously bad
it is a weird one where it was taken from my back and i look kind of weird smiling i look like i am thinking about raping little girls
haha i guess not you can in japan though and we will get a taste of that maybe this summer because i cant move on from this bullshit without letting her know
are you for fucking real
personal peace of mind she will probably reject me but i still need to tell her
i always had a crush on her when we started chatting i was having way too much fun chatting with her than with my ex but we dont talk nowadays
oh ya
yaya this is nothing dramatic
hmmmm i will think about it
but i appreciate your advice
took you to bbomb your date to do it lol
oh ya i was kind of forceful about my request to chat
end of april i will
wait what
my japan coop start in september
no i got summer courses lol
ya
but i think i can come back occasionally to toronto
right at the beginning of may
end of april i can come back to toronto to visit occasionally before we go to japan i think we are going to japan or on a trip right after my school finishes
ya for sure if you are in the area
they gave me like 5000 scholarship for starting a business in cognitive search engine
nah man i am trolling your nigger ass this is just the usual deans list scholarship
ya lol
ya cuz there are too many students at uoft i mean one college had like more than a hundred deans list but i do want to start a business in cognitive search in the future
it is like a more intelligent version of google like if you type in an actual well formed question a cognitive search would ideally give you a wellthought out answer
oh ya
i am thinking of a more specific kind of search that can be used in a research setting like for example if you ask the algorithm does protein fbx71 interact with cgtc motif of hepatocyte dna
ya it is i want to take on that project after i come back from japan
what do you mean with who by myself son you can learn everything you need on your own i dont need no goddamn supervisors although i would seek out potential collaborators possibly
nah man there aint no lab doing this kind of stuff i mean i am just dreaming big here but i will definitely try my hands on it thats for sure regardless of how unlikely it might be
shit ya negro you know i am
oh shieeet
what is this research
oohhhh shiieeeet you can cure brain cancer with that shit
yo you know last year when i was working at sickkids this professor at pgcrl identified a preexisting schizophrenia drug that can cure brain cancer that drug seemed to be already brain permeable though since it targets the brain
it doesnt sound very new though
brain blood barrier has been an existing issue for a while now maybe the technology for it is new
of course when you do that doesnt it damage the brain in anyway though
hmmm interesting
well my dude it sounds like an exciting project and i hope you get the position and i hope you can enjoy research again i mean not again this time
how did the interview go son
goddamn
he doesânt want your ass
neural as in like neuroscience
lol
who is this hotshot from undergrad
ya did that pi even have a good impression of you
so much politics involved in this whole shit
science is honestly ruined by this kind of politic but dude this nigger is publishing papers left and right he is quite prolific
if you are enthusiastic to work with him then maybe he will let you in
whatchu gonna do then
gg
yo can you remind me what was so pro about this prof the fact that he works 247
does he have like a wife or a life
are they like really old now
oh ok i wonder how they grew up with a father who works non stop
i am very curious how people like him can have a social life
i donât mean that in a demeaning way i want to work as hard as him but i donât see how to do it
lol you need more confidence son and not perform social comparison so much
having thoughts of inadequacy leads to unproductivity and lack of energy i just realized that today
what do you think
what did you not understand
yuko is the coordinator of this japan coop program
the program is offered from ubc but other schools like uottawa can participate honda research insitute
ya man but i am scared shitless about any kind of unexpected things happening and i dont know how strict they are with the requirements for arrival that is what i am worried about
if we come back earlier then i am all for it man
we leave on 25th we come back by 6th of aug that is slightly less than 2 weeks
yes thats right
well yes
i aint got a say in any of this matter you got to realize there are multiple levels of management i need to go through if i am to make my own proposal
yes i am cool with that
shit ya son but to be fair though i am in contact with this other man who will be working in the same company but he will start in may 14 or something
and i am not sure if you read the comment about japan is on vacation from 13  20
i just simply dont wanna risk nothing if it was you what would be a reasonable time line
the typical leave date would be september 2nd but none of that is official yet
well yes
ya i sure am being conservative son
lemme reread that piece of shit
you are saying that even though most businesses are closed the government should still act
lol god fucking damnit aint she the considerate woman
alright son i got your ass on this what time do you recommend we leave japan
the same time frame i get the visa
you want to stay in japan for close to 3 weeks
we will have to think about that but i wasnt planning to spend longer than 2 weeks
yes
alright
you are right on that how much do you plan on spending on this trip going to all these countries will take quite a bit of money i imagine
if you are staying for three weeks that is bawling out man
i know of a cheap place in tokyo
ya 2030 per night and it has absolutely everything you need i met some toronto meds last year in that place
ya son graduation trip it was
you mean tomorrow
but ya i have some new things to consider now
i can stretch the trip to 2 full weeks now
do you realize how much 3 weeks would cost that is going to be like more than 3000 we will see man we gotta make a plan first
3 weeks in japan hmmm i gotta process this shit man
but for now i am open minded provided that the schedule fits my visa shits
2 and half is the highest i will ever go for honestly 25 aint going higher than that
i am just paranoid as fuck
yes the way i do things i always leave some leeway even under the worst condition possible
haha i think you will enjoy it
i will be over in japan in christmas aint coming back
by the way man i got 6000 free scholarship from uottawa
thats gonna let me bawl out this time around
thanks buddy
it is a general engineering schoalrship i didnt even apply for it i guess just based on my grades i have basically 395gpa right now
the gpa
haha ya they wanna show their gratitude i ugess they dont got many talented students like uoft
you know what i dont know jackshit about why i got this schoalrship gpa definitely mattered but i have no explanation for the absurd amount i still got the regular 1000 deans list
haha ya i know and osap is giving us grant too l would have gotten like 8000 from them this study year if i wasnt doing coop i think the same applies to you no
like not loan money grant money
how much is it
dude this study year if i wasnt going to do coop i would have gotten like 8000 grant and 7000 loan it should have been the same for you no
i thought this is like a general thing cuz i remember us getting the same amount for our first year roughly 13k mostly loan
goddamn son i feel for you i guess it would be better to not look at the number in your situation lol
ya i am out too later son nice convo
human love is just about as genuine as robot love because at a fundamental level we are slaves to the chemicals secreted in our neurons
yes sir
i would be cool with that i also made a phone call to the japanese embassy in toronto this morning you were right about the visa processing they donât take breaks
wtf you were in toronto please donât tell me you were in toronto
you bet your ass i will be just got back
no i was on the road before then
yup how are you doing you wanted to discuss japanese sex bots
ya i know
do you agree with my previously stated belief though
sorry i didnât read the whole thing but what was that betrayal thing about
and what was the problem with not being able to refuse i mean the robot will be programmed to want your d so technically both parties will still be actively wanting it
as in where there is an element of risk in a relationship partners behave differently when
ya thatâs what was i talking about the same reason why being a thot is a turn off
well thatâs because that is exactly what it is it kind of goes in circle doesnât it having a robot waifu might make desperate men realize they need a real waifu
hmmmmi might be wrong
well yes
what is the unfair element can you enlighten me
that handsome guys get more goods
i have mixed feeling for that like beauty is a subjective thing and it is actually changing very dynamically like if you look at somebody long enough you will find that person attractive in some regards
well i wanna tell you now son that yestersay i was watching this medical drama with a burnt patient the burn didnât affect her face it affected between her upper chest to her neck and she said that ânobody will want to marry somebody like me nowâ
so you see how subjective this is
i mean that person became obese for a reason
do you know of a metabolic disorder that makes a person obese and how obese is this shit you are talking about people with a metabolic disorder arenât more obese than individuals who stuff their faces full of mcdonald
fair point and that would reduce the percentages of sexual goods available to them do you feel that this situation is unfair
do you think the people who are feeling unfair excessively comparing themselves to others who do get sex which makes the experience not satisfying and meaningless
hmm ok then maybe we do need more sex bots
ya having it normalized could have some effect on morality but porn has been successful so far so maybe keep the same business model for the sex bot by having it being sold underground
well it kind of is man at least more underground than 90 of the shits in the wolrd doesnât porn already promote a misogynstic view
sorry i still donât see the difference
right and sex bots will always be mysogynistic
a very complex issue indeed i am curious about examples of misogynstic sex bots
i am talking about sex bots
but that is precisely the reason why i am saying if sex bots want to have a chance of thriving it needs to be kept underground just like those maid girl porn
would you buy a sex bot by any chance
i aint talking about ethics i bet you have an immediate desire for some of that right instinctually speaking you know what that is a stupid question who wouldnt want to hit that
yo nigger you online
cuz i am in vancouver for orientation
ubc gotta train my ass up before i go to japan
ya
costed me some pretty penny
clarify then
i am going to japan for work there is no longer a reason for me to specifically go on a trip to japan especially when the potential time of travel is so close to my work start time
haha dude you should have told me that i was fucked in the head back then
sounds like me is this what you wanted to clarify
alright but you need to know the major reason why i donât want to travel to japan with you guys is because of my future work in japan
i might go there once every few years still
ya he is a tough cookie
so what do you wanna do man you gotta lay it on this nigger
lay the ultimatum or the muscle
is this the same discussion that i was in or you guys being talking aboit this privately
right i think we need to communicate with him our situation and if he cannot fulfill our desires then maybe we are incompatible adventure and budget are somethings that we cannot compromise but peter ainât interested in that
ya i understand you will be there for him as a friend when he needs your help but you are incompatible with him and so am i
not gonna be there this weekend
it ainât bullshit as your med school man
lol dude that is a life worth serving is it not i thought doctors had all this morality shit down
like no matter how hard you work you will know that you are working towards the right thing are you lamenting some people donât gotta work so hard
what do you mean in the last two statements
what is wasting away
wouldnât you enjoy mastering medicine though practicing and getting good at it
do you think those niggers that had âeasyâ life are more satisfied about themselves than we are
lol
that just came out of mowhere
lol
the troll spider
nite
shiiiiieeeeettt why are you coming back this and the next weekend i might come back on 20thâs weekend
in toronto
damnnnnn son i mean i can come back to toronto if i want to cuz i have control over my car but its gotta be a better reason than to just meet and chat
but how are you going back though do you get a free ride cuz i pay fucking 80 on gas fee every time i visit toronto
damn son you dedicated to your friends if that is the case i will seriously consider coming back the week after next sorry the week after this one
yup
where is it happening at
what is cne
i donât fucking know it man i might have heard it before but i have certainly forgotten it if i have
ok you gonna play in it or what
i will see what my situation is like but yo i still wouldnât think about coming back just to meet with you or peter
because you plan other things do you not i donât got anything beside you and peter in toronto
i will certainly but i naturally do not appreciate human contact as much as you
alright i will consider it
if i come back next time i wanna take care of the business with the trip and if we have enough time then we can mahj
well it is the same illogical reason as him wanting to go on a cruise he is illogical in many areas
so we gotta communicate with him properly face to face not necessarily about the maj but definitely the trip
i was actually considering putting up a reddit r post about this situation and ask for advicd
why
well that is probably what is going to happen i can already see what will happen so ya we gotta communicate this to peter clearly
a nigga with dreadlock lol that was a really unexpected way of describing the character
no there are a lot of africans though in uottawa people of african descent i mean but i think most of them speak french
i have worked with an african for a hackathon actually for both a hackathon and game jam but dude i dont go out of my way to just meet their black asses specifically you dig
so whats ur story son you got some time off from med thats why you got time to read up about niggas with dreadlock
anime has lots of underdog stories
i knew about it
that is also why i enjoyed some of them lol i read about the part about dbz being an underdog story but that could be easily extrapolated to other anime
you dont count stefan
stefan is too white washed though
that is generally what i observed as well but not just in the public like i watch lots of youtube videos with niggas in them and they over react to things quite often but it is also true
if you see a black nigga not over reacting to things then there is something wrong with him
like have you seen those news report videos about black people some of the funniest ones that went viral featured these hyperexcitable niggas aint nobody got time for that hide your wife hide your girls
they aint got nothing to lose and they live their life to the fullest that is their mentality i feel but where do they get this mentality
yes i am
well i appreciate that man do you think the world needs more people like that
evidently internet shares your opinion about their entertainment value ya it is hard as fuck to overcome that
really
wtf does that even mean
but that is not the sole purpose of dramatic display it is also to share the energy with people around you
i personally never felt that minority issue though you probably didnt neither we are starting to feel more of it now since we started trying to date white girls
and when we want to advance our careers our minority status will affect us even more
but like did they literally treat you differently or something
lol really
maybe thats how we became friend lol
like man the energy of the white boys on the first day of school seriously overwhelmed me
my tobeclassmates there were a few of them carson lambert ben shaleto tristan st
but i always felt like it was because of my weak communication skill that i felt overwhelmed not because of my ethnicity
i have seen asian people in my class who spoke fluently and loved by everybody like connie zhang she was more loved than some quiet white girls in my class
yes
connie zhang was a fucking beast even back in mid school her sociability was off the charts
lemme tell you man there was another asian kid called anthony cho who was a fucking beast everybody liked him cuz he was sociable but also to be fair they were liked partly because they did so well academically
he came from browns elementary did kleinman also come from browns i forgot
browns
i didnt know it was a rich schooli went there for summer camp before and i didnt get that impression a lot of students from browns went to deer park many of my classmates came from that school
i see
ya same here man
i actually thought you were well liked by a lot of people even back in those days
they would include you in their social gatherings but you didnt feel like you were close with many of them is that right
when i say social gatherings i dont mean like deliberate gatherings outside of school jjust everyday conversations and plays
well i remembered for you man and people call you out
to join them in their convos
man i wanna build a time machine to go back to those times and take advantage of good things that happened to me like man
and alex boris harmer was constantly playing with me in grade 8 and trying to get close to me but i refused interaction the first girl was alison grenier
ya
i made mistakes really i dont know
i never heard from her again after she entered high school
well alison grenier is some social ass girl i dont know what happened after high school graduation
what the fuck is she doing
ok
can you link me
that is pretty cool she was very sporty since mid school so it is not surprising she seems so happy living her life i would like to do the same
but that is what we should strive for though
she probably got mental issues or whatever but we should keep pushing forward i am surprised she became a chess instructor though because back in middle school she was literally one of the worst players on the chess team
ya but by the time we were on the same team she seemed like she had literally no interest in the game
what does the threshold have anything to do with this
but she still needs to be a good player to be an instructor hmmmm ok i dont know
i hope to see her in the future in toronto she was on this a few years ago when i last checked her maybe alison is not the correct spelling
httpswwwlinkedincominalisongrenier this is the girl by the way i have decided a while back that i am going to build my future around toronto
ya right
it is kind of like a life mission i am just very patriotic and want to serve my country and toronto is a good place to do it since it is the most technologically forward city in canada
well i never had that dream anyways i am just telling you that i wanna see your ass in toronto in a few years
thats great there are too many nostalgia in that city i wanna meet up with alex and alison again sometime in the future share how they are doing with their lives
lol ya it would be kind of they might think that but i wouldnt anyways yo i gotta get going for my class nice talking to you man
dude have i told you to watch the good doctor that show is da bomb man
you sure enjoy scifi zerg shits
dude when i played magic with you in middle school i should have chosen the simic deck man i still have nightmares about your noxious ghoul killing my fucking tokens
i dont play casually but i am considering moving myself to a different game now that i feel like dota2 has ran its course
but like magic is a game that has opponents when you have opponents the only way to have fun is beating the shit out of them and that requires competitive drive
well no
well yes so what are you trying to say son that i can play magic the same way i play dota if that is what you are saying then yes you are right
well maybe i am full of dogshit
stefan zivkovic
lol is he a better player than you
right
what is his format ya you are not bad but you aint into beating up other people
i am a fucking spike unfortunately for you spikey personalities are typically rooted in insecurities developed over childhood over inferiority
no it is just my own hypothesis but even i can see flaws in this because i have observed this competitive tendency in myself since a young age
ya i understand that maybe i should just stick with single player game honestly because so much work needs to be put in magic and other games
i actually havenât finished the game so i donât know what that is
and the reason why i havenât finished is because i get bored of things that donât offer instant gratifications which is problem that affects a lot of things in my life
ya but i kept trying hoping that i would win like i never lost hope
it is actually the same ironically because i never would have kept on trying if i wasnât hoping to win my next game which i think is the reason why i couldnât get as high gpa as you
well try to be more open minded i guess maybe i should give magic a try who knows or just stick with single player games
haha ya thatâs right
yo where did you learn to say âquench your thirstâ
ok
i heard of that phrase in a movie
the movie with the black military trainer look up the âbest insults in movieâ and you will find the nigger interestingly there are lots of niggers in that clip
but yo i will consider playing magic someday man maybe after i come back from class today
what do you use to play online cockatrice
ok httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbbillmcid5g look at 141
yeh nigger the best magic deck costs like 1400 modern magic deck
i saw like the cheapest meta deck was like 400  500
cryptic commands costs like 100 nowadays
wish i had saved mine from like 10 years ago
lol dude i am going to japan in september and i am coming back to toronto in august
even if we talk about all this shit i am not likely to seriously come back until like next year summer
right but japan has a pretty good magic scene
lol that kid is still playing huh
how is shuhei nakamura
ok
how expensive is this ad nauseam deck typically
lol i was reading the wrong deck i thought tron was ad nauseam cuz tron won in a tournament where ad nauseam was in
well it is a combo deck at its core i barely played combo deck back in the days
lol this ad nauseam deck i was laughing as i was watching a deck tech of ad nauseam it is such a fucking troll deck
goldfish
i wasnt laughing at his way of talking i was laughing at the deck it really makes me wanna try it out now lol when can you play
ok i wont be awake at that time but ok
11pm
thirst you bet son
yo
cockatrice is no longer supported
how do you get it
ya
yo when you play spoils of the vault in this deck you can accidentally lose can you not ok i am on discord
you give me an invite or some shit give me the link
my goal is to win enough tournament credits to buy myself one of those tier one decks
lol ya it seems like it
what are some good ways to get cards useful for the meta then
alright i am just getting a taste of this shit
but thanks for your time man i gotta work too now later
op is thot you didnt send this message to the wrong person
ya i probably did yo negro i need to ask you for a favor do you still have syllabus of chm220 and chm247 that we took back in uoft
i thought you kept a track record of all the shits from school
lol dumbass nigger
how is life man are we even serious about going to europe
and thats it
then how come none of us did any research
ya he would but i am a bit disappointed in us that we havent made any progress i didnt do any mostly because i prefer to be led by others in these sorts of things
well we aint
yo would you be down to go to japan for 2020 olympic
2020 july  aug late july to early aug
thats too bad
so this summer is the last time we gonna spend some quality time huh
i still got one more summer left
i think they will give you paid time offs that you could use
right
nah man magic is a fucking shit game and you know it
yo are you playing magic now
ok
i can play some with you for fun on cock but i am not dedicating myself to piloting decks like ad nauseam i wanna feel the opness of cards i want to use cryptic commands you dig
ya i want the best one
give me it
thanks for the message nigger my wish this year is to be able to fuck multiple japanese sweet hearts
no problem man it ainât a thang we might have been able to do it if we went to japan for vacation
nah
nvm i might only be able yo fuck one sweet heart
i would hurt her feeling if i fucked multiple
yes
i am fucked up man i hope one can satisfy the other but like wouldnât you wanna fuck lots i guess you can still do that with one girl
ya i guess my first statement about multiple wasnât serious i urge you to do it with one
gg things are tough for us did any of the girls in your class breakup sure would be nice if they did wouldnât it
how the fuck do they not break after 2 years are they like trying real hard or what
g fucking g boyfriends moved over there try hard niggers
no i understand i might do that one day in the future i am just awed by how serious people are
how is life over there man are you almost finished
ya you can definitely get something done in toronto man like you made pretty good progress during your brief visits to toronto while at windzor you even dropped some grills over there so you got the upper hand
well you understand that it is a dice roll game rght you ainât gonna meet your soul mate or nothing on your first encounter
but depending on your confidence and skill you can flirt the shit out of them and then fuck them hard like seeing yourself improve in dating skills is a good motivator to keep going do you see yourself improving
have you ever flirted with girls before though flirting is fun
dating is certainly a grind if you think about it like that i guess it is hard for you to see it any other way huh
dude there is always mood for flirting man unless you are tired of the girl
dannnnng son how are you gonna find a goddamn girl if you dont flirt shes gotta be a fucking stone to be fine without flirting flirting releases tension in the interaction and it also adds a bit of fun
yo i wish i am like you right now cuz i wanna focus and get shits done but sometimes i am just thirsty as fuck and i cant control it
yeah thats what i do everyday
nigger you back in toronto
nah i aint but i am coming back for long weekend we gotta motherfucking take care of this shit with peter like take care ð« you know
july 1st motherfucker
but dude
i dont need to see your dumb ass
i aint got time for you i got girls who wanna see my ass they are coming after me in hordes but yo serious business wtf are we gonna do about peter and we are acting too slowly
well it had to be done though otherwise it could take us ages to book and peter is taking his sweet time answering i think he is delaying the inevitable
if he doesnt wanna go then we wont go i mentioned that
right
ya i hear ya man but i think peter will have to understand our position since we brought it out in the open it is fair game and if he is a true friend then he would understand
not exactly if i have literally 2500 in my bank account then he cannot expect me to take a loan or borrow money from him just to go on a vacation
i think we needed to have laid out exactly what we are expecting to do on a vacation earlier it wasnt enough to just say we are going to x y and z so will you do that please
alright
yo this nigger ainât budging do you see him trying to comvince us to bawl out
well i did crack his ass down but dang it dude at this rate we ainât gonna go anywhere in the summer
alright i will leave it up to you then
ok
nigger be bawling hows your first week in toronto man or was this the second week
you sunny brook now or you downtown
working with iozano
well you talked about him last time
cool stuff son what are you doing exactly
i am sure a med student can do more than crunching numbers right
you mean you are going to write a paper
ok then that is not just crunching numbers son wording
how is your social life in toronto
how are they doing
in what way
he went all the way out to edm
is that anaesthesia mostly used for surgery purposes
ya i get you man
anathesiologists are quite important what makes you say that
ya i suppose so he is a confident guy
ya i hear ya i aint doing it either but you got to book that plane ticket soon like i would recommend you meeting up with the nigger
you aint gonna waste nobodys time
so when will we do that
i mean i got some time this weekend i guess that is what i should be doing
when will you be in the mood
i am not familiar with europe as you are
what is attractive about turkey we should not do it
ok well if we are gonna do it then we gotta be serious about it
like literally set up a time this weekend to go on skype or some shit
ya me neither son
i dont know anything about this world man i was hoping you would surprise my ass with some nice places
cuz i spend all day jerking off in my room i dont spend much time thinking about htings outside of my life
ya thats pretty much what i am but maybe you can change that about me
hmmm ok i think i will try that do you read travel blogs
lol dude you told me to not get jjealous of that shit
fucking dogshit people man why do they gotta make their lives look good we all know that they are living dogshit lives but logically i know that is really meaningless
i could ahve done that for my ex and i could post my achievements every day on fb but that would be immature of me because in the end i dont actually get anything out of it
but yo i would consider doing it for jokes in the future if i actually get many worldly possessions i will get back to you later about the places that we should go to
it feels like nothing to be honest
alright then i will pick some exciting places for you i am gonna do a bit of research maybe we will end up hiking a lot or some shit
i thought peter aint cool with anything but i will keep that in mind
i thought you were assuming that he aint gonna come with us and i feel like he wont after we give the ultimatum
alright we will do many alternatives at least a few
alright
grounded by reality you need to read papers in your lab man no matter how much data you crunch your interpretation of the data wont mean much if you dont know jackshit about your literature
i hope you gain more motivation dude
i dont believe you will though cuz i have known you for too long and shit doesnt change overnight excuse my frankness
that is some humanistic shit i didnt expect to hear but it is not surprising that he might think that we are mortal after all and we experience stress like any other people
iozano my nigger
oh shit
well if you read enough papers and show that you are smarter than him then he will talk to you anyways man i gotta refresh my ass and get some objectives done
well you definitely wont with that attitude and yo i was just watching some travel vlogs of different places places i have seen are like norway various cities paris nature and cities in switzerland prague and berlin
right then i canât give you any advice on where we can go unless we choose places that maximizes on natural places and hope that they are doable
because all the european cities are the sane for me
i would love to go to cities but i canât distinguish between prague and paris for example
cultural wise architecture wise and city wise i know they are different cities literally
of course but i donât know jack shit about them
what i am saying is doesnât make a difference where we go in terms of cities but i would be more picky when i am choosing based on natural places
ya sure
that is interesting i wanna see some otter skorzeny shit
something we rarely see of him
so i canât make nazi jokes
sure did not see that coming
ya they censored wolfenstein in germany i have a good idea of how seriously they take that shit
sits well withme
well
didnt you say that place is complete utter dog shit in terms of sanitation
oh you want adventure huh
we might consider going to some more exotic places in europe then what kind of adventure are you specifically looking for somewhere that is absolutely out of ordinary from our urbane lives
there are some great natural locations in europe we dont have to stay in city and natural locations are almost always crazy
provided taht we choose the right ones
lemme see if i can dig up some of those videos i saw a few days ago
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkjxsfpmt0uw this one has a small focus on nature more on city httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbsfqzjbkvkg and this next one is norway
there are some great places if you do some digging but i would leave the logistics of them up to you
so you need help with finding places to visit huh
alright so lets set some kind of constraint here man
alright i guess thsi will involve a lot of work huh should have asked me about this last week son yo by the way but on the menu they say it is like only 25 httpsdocswixstaticcomugd2b293e69221b10aadc44cfb9c9ebaa45d99a3bpdf
but is says dinner is 23
so the price went up like fucking 50 on a holiday
i want to go there again but i dont wanna go there if i dont know what to expect it is fucked up but ok yo what are you doing next weekend
alright
i get a feeling that they charged extra for us staying later than closing time
so we paid 4302
i just checked my bank history
we had to pay like 10 tip which was like around 37 and then 12 service charge
that is like around maybe another 37 oh ok so then the final cost of that shit was basically 40 the regular cost is 23
from the menu
wtf
their pdf menu doesnt same the same thing nvm was looking at the wrong shit
and yes they are expensive it is not worth going for lunch but yo i dont know if this means anything but after i came back to ottawa that weekend biking suddenly felt very easy
but like i cant cook meat delicious enough for me to want to suddenly eat that much i wouldnt eat that much meat under normal circumstance but anyways meng bao said he wants to go to gyubee again
i would just get tons of amino acid supplement ya that is right
i dont take it that seriously to be honest but the meat was delicious
lol ya that guy always wanna bawl the fuck out that is what is gonna happen on the trip if we invite that nigger i am gonna get down to some research now actually own
ya i know about it that came out a long while ago yo so are you still interested in experiencing local culture and shit in the trip you just want more adventurous places than you had previously thought
ya i get you man
i really have no planning experience so it is easier for me to think about a smaller region also reduces the chance of messing up somewhere stretching yourself too thin you know httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvunkjlifwkk
ya i know this is just a video that will motivate us to visit these places you dizzy motherfucker you you said you wanted to fucking plan something but i hear nothing from your fucking ass
nigger finally man
ya and i think i know where i want to go or i have a good enough idea
parisinterlakenmunichberlincopenhagen that is my rough path i think i will find enough interesting things in this path but i am willing to compromise if you have other suggestions
ok that is fine with me
maybe we can go to a more naturalistic place in france
the location is surrounded by water so mabye there could be some nice scenaries look i am more interested in making a decision at this point and i heard similar thing about munich from a german friend of mine
who
are they niggers
ya
3 china men and 1 white so whats it matters if they wanna come if they wanna come they can
dude it is 5 weeks till we travel if we are travelling at all we gotta make a fucking decision very rapidly if not we are gonna make the decision for them
i am cool with that
as long as you dont find me boring
lol in what sense
lol what am i gonna fucking do
yo i will promise you i will follow whatever restriction in terms of language that you have on me
i dont have a concrete plan but i have done some search online and got some motivations to travel to those places is all interlaken is the most naturalistic place i know of in europe
no the people who went only had backpacks hey look man i aint trying to get you to decide right now but i do want to trigger some conversation with you
if you can convince me to do outside of europe then i am cool with that
yes we will present the plan to him and if he doesnt like it then we are done
thats goddamn right but the thing is neither one of us wants to compromise and if we try to take him into consideration he will just stall for time
i was gonna ask you does trains in europe operate during night time
do trains
we might sleep on trains
lol why not
alright
sure thing
i still wanna hear where you wanna go
i mean are you saying it is costing like 1700 if we had booked like earlier then it would be like 1300
wait i thought you said asia is 1700 then south am is out
ok
no shit by the way i like the south america stuff i am seeing but are they all scattered over the continent
to be honest i like natural beauty shits much more so than cities but do you have an estimate on these places
ya
including food and shit
ya i got you
by the way you have been to a few of these places have you not
i think i was recommending patagonia earlier when we first started planning for this trip that is most certain a beautiful location yo i wanted to ask you about the living condition there
did you finish charging son
if you think it is too expensive and adventurous then we dont have to do it like how expensive and adventurous is it and going to south america itself will stretch our endurance to the limit
wtf only 3k that is madness
but 60 day though yo what happened last time you went to peru
like how was your experience at peru how much survival skill do you need to travel there
why didnt you guys get like a fucking umbrella or rain coat
protecc
why didnt you guys have sandals
oh it was shieeeet
how much in celcius
dude that is nothing i wear fucking sandals at 5c
ok so now it is summer it should be a bit warmer right
what did you guys eat
oh hellllll naaaaaawwww
can you give me some examples
why did they give you guys diarhea
hmmmm is there anyway that you can avoid that kind of shit if we go to sa in august
at the end of the day man it doesnt matter too much where i go as long as it can be fun i am just waiting for you to finish your research and make a decision
well the thing is i did my research on europe i also did some research on areas like iceland and other scenic places but i dont remember who but somebody told me that iceland is expensive as fuck now
so ya once you look over the potential travel routes and feel satisfied with your research we need to make a decision
never i didnt wanna be caught by the local niggers and be their slaves slave and africa is mostly a desert is it not
lemme check damn you are right there are some beautiful places there is actually a high concentration of nice looking places in the south part of africa the price to africa is too high now 1800  2000
so like when do you expect to finish your research
ya i can tell you are
it is at least a good step that you acknowledge this lets go by budget cuz that is the easiest shit to go by
going to europe by flight will cost by around 1300 honestly why are we not just selecting europe norway has some absolutely beautiful locations we can start off from there
and work down and get to switzerland
dark
i seriously wish we had discussed about this earlier dude the price of the plane tickets probably increased by like a few hundred bucks between may and now i am thinking about travelling between italy and denmark
i wanna go from august 1 to like 13th
what do you mean flexibility
i dont wanna go for that long
so what is wrong with 13 is that too early
i gotta be back by 13
i need to send my passport to the japanese consulate for visa validation that can take 2 weeks at latest
and then i wanna give the jjapan people enough time to prepare after my visa gets validated they want me to start the first week of september and they will fly me at day or two earlier
yes
i can push it to 14th but thats it
you cant depart on early august 1 so like we leave at night or some shit
thats cool with me
ya
south africa cape town specifically
so you didnt wanna do it
south africa is off the table too
yes well i am adding in italy because i dont know whether we will have enough stuffs to do
so maybe we should be ok with just switzgerden that is like 4 days in each country
visit the mountains the alps so whats the verdict
why is that i mean we are jjust climbing some shit
we wont but hopefully we get to climb a lot and see some beautiful scenaries
didnt you say last time that turkey is dangerous
so what are you looking at now

honestly i am cool with that too
if we are sticking in only canada then i can come back as late as i want
ok sure
lol sure i got no problem with that did you get anything son
go deeper man always go deep you gone deep son
that doesnt concern me one bit you can take however much amount of pictures yo so what is going on with you
oh shit are you busy now then
happy birthday to your father
so you want to involve budapest and prague
how are their plane ticket costs or are we gonna go there by train
if we get a return ticket deal i think we can get the whole thing for 1400 or soemwhere close so like i can forsaken copenhagen for those two places
it is the only place that has water nearby and that can be potentially good for scenaries to be honest it is a superficial reason so then whats in prague and budapest
anyways man forget about her she aint nobody
well i dont fucking know anything else about her
what the fuck is ravnica
i dont remember no goddamn ravnica thats shits out of my mind now so yo would you book the tickets like today or tomorrow if we include those two places
lol
well neither do i i think the best thing we can do is just try to pick the best possible places in theory that looks good we are not experts in this at all
you mean like peru what locations are you referring to
we could have gone to south africa if we had booked tickets in advance but that place is expensive as fuck right now and to be honest man
to be honest at the rate we are going i am not feeling too hot about this trip business that is just my honest feeling cuz i know jackshit about anywhere outside of japan
but that is kind of boring right city tourism i mean
yes
so like by the time you regain your excitment assuming that you will how expensive would the plane ticket be it would have increased like a few hundred bucks
i am saying that plane tickets increase in price the closer we book it to the travel date isnt that a general thing
what got you going for peru your classmates hyped it up for you
how long did you spend at peru 2 weeks
what were you doing for that whole week other than visiting mp
wait so you camped out
unfortunately europe i all about the culture and the city there is barely anything resembling mp in terms of nature epicness in europe
why wre you interested in paris what made it exciting for you before
but that is just one thing that was enough to excite you
ok
ok then lets make the decision i am down we arent gonna progress anymore discussing where to go we should make the decision i wanna interlaken for the only alpine country in europe and hitler
i mean now that you mention it yes and i meant one of the few alpine countries but it is the one that is closest to where we want to go so when are we gonna book
ok i will say something tomorrow right now i am watching dota2
sorry
so we made peace with the nigger we should book when we have today or tomorrow
ya we took care of him ð«
i wouldnt necessarily i dropped a fool say httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvol1zolo3s7s nigger when do you wanna book yo nigger what is going on
it aint my cup of tea it is too fucking far from the rest of where we wanna go unless we change our trajectory
you mean tnm
oh nice congrats son if you wanna do those areas i am cool with it like i said before we just gotta make a decision
i mean what is holding your ass back dude so if you are still indecisive dont expect any effort from me and you better spend every fucking minute you have that is free to come down to a decision
just know that the clock is ticking airplane tickets are rising every motherfucking day
3 day clock
thats a hell of a lot longer than any clock you were on yesterday so it shoulldnt be hard to overcome it
well i am clocking you now so get your fucking asses together

httpsmygraduateschoolwordpresscom20180629avoidingthemostdangeroustrapingraduateschool
well yes i kind of knew that
he sent you a message
and he replied
i mean we gonna go for tent so of course he wouldnt agree but anyways i am gonna do some search now to compare budapest and prague
i went through two sites so far and both seems to agree that prague is better
budapest got good beer and crowd apparently the crowd in prague is apparently humongus precisely because prague is way more tourism worthy httpbbqboynetpraguebudapestvisit are you reading this
budapest is great for getting immersed in the culture whereas prague is great for seeing wow scenes
like scenaries that will make you go holy shit
so then prague
i also cant handle that alcoholic shit neither
the one thing that i will say though is that prague is overrun by tourists apparently so it will be hard to experience the city in its pure beauty and glory
prague
not every place in prague you still need czech
lol
we can try that up
yo honestly i am gonna vouch for prague
what we can try is starting our day early
if we start our day early we can get some nice photos of the place before sun rises
i am totally down for that
so we ready to book
ok so are we waiting for them
ya how long are you waiting for them
ok
ok dude i got this strange thing that happened in front of me in the subway today i need you to listen to me
so like there was this incredibly hot looking woman who were dressed scantly and she sat beside me on the train i didnât really mind it when it happened and i was reading stuffs on my ipad
she might have been like 2 or 4 years older than me i couldnât tell she was wearing short pants and her legs were some fine sight to behold
actually she was
nope oh wait
maybe we did i was looking at her face when she got over to my compartment but ok eye contact huh
possible lol i find it unlikely too for the record i want back by 13th i think i said 14th before but that is a little late in my book
you bet your ass it is
i think that is good the switzerland decision anyways it is on our way anyways so we arenât losing any time travelling but we will book plane to munich and from prague
why
oh right it is between france and aus forgot about thay
ya well i heard berlin is a shit looking place so i stay with munich we are booking today at like 8pm no matter what we can read into this piece of shit and change our minds forever
yes
do you think we have enough time to do everything we would wnat to do if we add switzerland if you think we do then we add if not we dont
i dont wanna go to a city and feel like there were things that i should have visited but didnt have the chance to
i am checking now i think most trains dont work night
i just checked man there are a select few night trains in europe but they dont offer the connections we want
you can find it on night trains in europe but if you look for more custom trains on raileurope you cant find a single night train
oh shieeeet
they are fairly good the prices i mean we can take them from munich  vienna  prague and we wouldnt lose day time
yes i just checked httpswwwnightjetcomen check from vienna to prague
ya
it will be 140 euro for both of us to go from vienna to prague
we can book right now
ya
oh shiet who is tommy
is he a nigger from your med class
asian motherfucker from chinois
alright
if you wanna see real natural shit in swiss you need to go to interlaken and interlaken is not well connected with the rest of the places we want t ogo
ya
3 days in munich 4 days in vienna and 3 days in prague that is like 10 days
ya
if we stick with our original schedule we can spend like 4 days per city original plan i meant
i think i would prefer to keep it straightforward this time around we can go to interlaken for a day trip though if you are down to spend 5 hours back and forth between zurich and interlaken
ya
oh wait sorry we arent going to zurich nvm
ya i think we should stick with the three original cities
the only places that i wanna go in switzerland are interlaken or lucerne i aint interested in switzerland as a country and i trust that you can identify things to do in the three original places
ya
yo i wanna go to berlin now
lol yo if he wants it it is cool
berlin is a bigger metropolis than munich and i love metropolis but i can handle both honestly they both sit well with me
i am looking it up now there are a few places that we can go from munich with great natural scenaries but i also love how berlin is more modern and is more metropolitical
is that like a huge thing wangstein
by the way all of these great places near munich are not very close they are all at 1  2 hours drive from munich city berlin can offer interesting things to do more consistently
if we go to munich we will definitely need a car and a goddamn gps
eagles nest and there is another mountain that can be hiked yo lemme tell you man for now i am gonna stick with berlin actually but i will leave the end decision up to you
alright the deal is done
berlin to prague right
i think we should do the opposite we found the night train from vienna to prague we just need to do prague to berlin night train
oh shiiiiieeeet am i stupid or what i sort of made that assumption cuz i am not even thnking now
alright
we already found the prague and veianna
ya i am checking too and i cant find it
yes
the fuck nigger i wanted august 13
is there no 13th flight
i gotta think about it

alright
alright i wil lget back to you later
ok httpswwwhostelworldcomhosteldetailsphpbaxpaxdowntownhostelhotelberlin15426datefrom20180802dateto20180806numberofguests3reviews this one is pretty good it is located close to downtown and the price is one of the best httpswwwhostelworldcomhosteldetailsphpballhausberlinhostelberlin273176datefrom20180802dateto20180806numberofguests3scpos12 this one is also very close to downtown similar price range for both 20  30
aint sure about what the ac
if you want ac maybe we can go higher in the price range the ones i looked at are between 20  30 dollars
ya
cad
ok well between the price range of 50 only one hostel has ac
only one hostel has free wifi and ac if we dont include free wifi then we got 2 but they are 4km  from downtown
ok
you sent a photo so we got one that is 4km
the other is 16km isn isnt airbnb same as hostel
ok none of the affordable places have ac
checking that shit now
httpswwwairbnbcarooms2062279locationberlin2c20germanyadults3children0infants0guests3checkin20180802checkout20180806sn0c3lb22 this is the one that we want ac wifi close to station and 30 per person
that one doesnt have ac son do you even read
no there are only like 7 in that website that has ac at the price range of 120  and the one that i showed you has enough beds for us and the cheapest
you arent gonna get any other good fit
you can either go for 1 bed or 8 beds
i dont wanna sleep on the floor
alright let me see how this works the train system in berlin seems to involve lots of transitions going from that airbnb to downtown requires 3 transitions going from airport to that place takes like 4
1 hour from residence to downtown and same for airport to residence
i dont know how big of a deal the ac is if it isnt then we can easily get a hostel instead of this airbnb
is that for real
google report says it is typically 24
you sent a photo
ok i see you
ya
the first one dont have ac
the second one neither
ya so are we saccing it if we are then hostel will be cheaper for all of us
and much closer to downtown ya
ya similar sorry but you got to take into consideration of the transportation fee
if we find a room without too many people then we wont be disturbed as much
lol ok
nah i fucking hate socializing cuz i am a sociopathic freak
ok do it
not yet
i found two good ones
they have the same price both really close to downtown
httpswwwairbnbcarooms17633505locationberlin2c20germanyadults3children0infants0guests3checkin20180802checkout20180806 httpswwwairbnbcarooms3762939locationberlin2c20germanyadults3children0infants0guests3checkin20180802checkout20180806sprbeaw78 they only got 1 queen bed and 1 sofa bed the one hosted by gotz is in a quiet neighborhood so that is one thing going for him
if you scroll to bottom you will see it
i like gotz place more
ya they are i will ask tom if his palce is quiet
for tom
alright i will choose gotz then
you sent a photo so you cool with this
ya sure i can do it
supposedly he is yo actually i am changing my mind to tom because gotz doesnt let you check in till like 7pm we arrive at 10am that day tom lets you check in at 1pm which is slightly better
no fucking clue son
tom is at least 1pm
nah havent done it yet
it takes a long process tom
dude fuck gotz man
not anymore
httpswwwairbnbcarooms3762939locationberlin2c20germanyadults3children0infants0guests3checkin20180802checkout20180806sprbeaw78
i am asking him if we can checkin earlier but honeslty i think we will get to his house at around 12pm which is honestly not that bad
i am asking him anyways but if you dont give a shit about his answer we can book now i think we can handle not being able to check in for 1 hour
oh really why
oh right
ya i checked his profile he from couver so we book him now
alright nigger there is an option for us to pay separately using this website do you wanna use that option you are just gonna get a payment link
ok
its cool i will do it up
just did it up the booking is not confirmed yet but i will hear an answer within 24 hours
yo so we gotta check out on like 1pm on the last day are we going to prague by train for our 4 hours
alright
oh ya we are a young studentflatshare and we accommodate you in our living room with pleasure how is this shit so cheap 48 for 3
oh really how is it a shit hole
lol ok
the checkin time for this place is 6pm are we gonna get there late
i mean
are we squeezed in with other people or some shit
ok that is not bad at all
johanna doesnt even look that hot the profile picture is not that high quality
ok
i mean what does the berlin airbnb has anything to do with it and today i wanna work on my assignment that is due tomorrow i will have time to talk to you after afternoon tomorrow
i mean i dont mind honestly as long as it doesnt affect the berlin airbnb booking
i still dont know why you are asking me about berlin
ok
but like you still ok with 4 days in berlin i cant cancel once the decision is made
or the refund could be incomplete
but if you are considering downshifting to 3 days for berlin then you need to let me know now to cancel
ok then thats that
the airbnb guy rejected our booking apparently because we asked him whether we can checkin early i am asking him again whether we can book if we wait
in prague
sorry what are you asking me
how much is it without it
villa place is only 15 min from downtown
why does it say it is only 15min i am in the gym right now so i canât help you with the decision and tomâs place is booked
so we gotta go with gotz possibly or somebody else
i havenât booked his place yet are we ok with 7pm check in lol i will ask him i guess
nigger i need your fucking email and tommys fucking email god fucking damn it
and yo i booked with gotz because he said we can get in before 7pm by asking for key from neighbor
nope
i would do anything for my brother
fucking pussy
fwang100uottawaca
cuz i didnt send nothign to you boys we booked that shit you dont got nothing to worry about
ok
is he arriving early
i told you last time gotz says that we can do early check in but we will have to communicate with him near the date of check in to make sure that we work something out
ya he is a med school man for sure
but i dont see why he is worrying when he is arriving later than us
oh right well gotz didnt say anything specifically you wanna figure this shit out now
thanks captain obvious nigger what is going on with you
i havenât actually are you working over weekend
damn son youve been slack for the past month when do you want to finish planning this trip
i did
do we got to bring dress to go into concertos
ya i feel the same too hope they arent elitists
werent you the one who wanted to go into one
right httpstianrenwanggithubio nigger you gotta check this shit out
are you using chrom nigger
what in the name of fuck thatâs some bullshit right there man i am gonna have to test it out later
nigger got his life set good for him he bullied the shit out of peter though the nigger is my true enemy because of that nigger did you update your chrome at all recently
thatâs right who did you socialize with yesterday you do a lot of socializing
that is a good attitude i should go meet some people when i get the chance
i try my best but nowadays i havenât focused much on girls i gotta get better at communicating
i ainât for sure there just arenât any girls around me who are good targets
oh shit son
dude so you are basically telling me that i canât be myself
can i question his faith though
does he have a gf
well i can respect that i donât wanna taint our innocent child here that ainât my purpose here
yeah
ya i gotta watch ti8 while we are on the trip
yes
the thing is itâs just hard to not be spoiled if you are watching it not live and i wonât hold back trip time for that
ya you do that man the final is actually near the last day of the trip oh wait sorry ti doesnât start until like aug 15 this year is unusually late huh
i have a hard time dealing with pure and innocent people cuz my mind is full of darkness
maybe i will question his faith actually yo despite my atheism i still utter biblical shits occasionally
so maybe we will get along
ya thats right
i wont i dont really know how to give people a hard time until i get familiar with them
ya man thats how i get close to people i cant connect with people unless i get to know them deeply
it is 45 is it not sorry 42
ok
we got enough places we dont need to visit every single one of them
ya i looked over everything on the fb chat
ya it is in there
i want to go to aquarium and possibly the zoo
definitely the aquarium cuz i am a big aquarium guy
you know what i was kind of scared of that but they said they got sharks and shit
hmmm ok
zoo than aquarium or aquarium than zoo
ok actually we might be able to skip that they aint got shit i just checked
ya
i havent checked none
ya
get some of that bradwursts
ya for sure do we need to plan out where to visit in advance there are a few things that we need to book in advance tho
neue museum and reichstag building
neue museum is extremely popular reichstag building just needs to let them know when we are coming if we dont tell them in advance we can wait in line for like forever
i can take care of those things for us
ya
apparently it is so popular that everybody wanna go and if we dont book in advance we can wait in line for like forever
they put that booking thing to limit the tourists
we will check it
it is a mountainous region with lots of good sights that is switzerland in general i dont know much about the place thomas recommended
ya nigger he be my thomas
anyways i am hitting the sack nigger i got only like 4 hours of sleep last night this shit aint good for my health if i dont go to sack now later
nigger i am working my ass off how about you man
assignment
and i gotta fucking study for finals later
yooooooo are you for fucking real
gg
i got fucking dunked on just now
you bet man
dude back in middle school i had to practice some water rescue shit with alexander bh cuz we missed school for chess
and i had to like do this shit where i am dragging her in water where my underside was touching her back and man lemme tell you i had an erection from that shit
dude i was worried as hell whether she felt that shit couldnt tell if she did cuz her behavior afterwards suggested like nothing happened
you sure about that
whatever dude
she is still hot in my eyes
did you get an erection today or did you control that shit like a monk
lol you should join me in the mountains in the future
i think we would be great partners but i would have to go through meditation to rid myself of lust and stuff
which mountain
well i said i want to go too
ya them bratwursts we gotta stuff our faces with it yo who was that girl who did the first aid did you get her number
i will chat with you in a bit i am heading out
lol you are right i just wanted a reason for me to dislike her like she seems like such a kind and earnest person normally but logically i know that she is irresponsive and lack energy
oh i dont think she cares about me that is why i am not asking her out i am pretty sure she doesnt give a shit about me man
i am barely friends with all of these girls i dont think me seeking a relationship wit h them now works if only i hanged out with them often
simply put i lack the skill to date unfuckingfortunate
i dont fucking know maybe i dont know what i am talking about yo nigger my father is driving me to the airport on the date of the flight at 3pm what is your plan on that day
yeh so you going with ur father
alright i guess i will see ur ass in the airport on the 1st our asses goes down
lol i am gonna troll that son so hard man but we all gonna laugh about it
and he will see de way by the time i am done with him
yo does this kid at least exert a powerful presence around him or is he a meek son does he need a leyline of the meek
lol thats some powerful shit right there
he doesnt like confrontation yo i think after i spend two weeks with you boys i am gonna be as smart as you guys how old is he by the way
lol damn man i aint the perfect guy to marry by the way i think i have too much instabilities jesus christ so i am gonna be dealing with a husbando material huh i will look forward to it
ok i understand but i dont think i have ever met a guy in my life who actually fits that description so i am curious to see what he is like
ya i am gonna find out the man that is tommy the ideal asian partner
what is this for
ok broodstarfrankhotmailcom
oh ya i love that man hipster the fuck does that mean
ok
ok also when are we going to do the day trips in berlin
alright i will decide on it then
i havent done any restaurant ressearch
i am gonna get to the airport early so honestly i might do some research there i am busy studying for exams right now
ya
fuck these shits man
lol ok son i would 1010 go back into research but only if i dont find anything better to do but right now i do
yo i got a dating story to tell man i recently started using plenty of fish app which supposedly was helpful if you want to sext i havent done much of that yet but that is another discussion
i mean everything she ainât no intellectual she is not industrious she loves hanging out with people and her career situation is low class
nah i ainât i just chatted with her because i didnât really see why not but after talking with her i donât think we will be a good fit at all sorry she looked ok for a black girl
it is hard for me to completely rule out anything but i dont think i will talk to her again
well i dont care about that but i am and she certainly wasnt
she wants to go to school but she has been putting that off for reasons probably because she just dont have the heart for it and she lacks motivation how the fuck do you only get there at 28
lol what
i aint blaming her
i undersatnd exactly the reasons why she is in that position
i can generalize and they are probably correct
it is not right to speculate
it is not just her situation but her attitude is not attractive based on my speculation anyways son thats that i just deleted the app too cuz i didnt what i want out of it
how is your project going man did you already finish it
i think you dont have the right mindset for research research skill wise is just as much art as it is science
you need to feel excited about the end result and look forward to it that is why you put extra work in to finish
are you generally bad at looking far ahead or is it just research that you dont give a shit about
hard to change that on your own or rather it is but where does the motivation to change come from
does this affect other things in your life i feel like it does
ok it is just my general impression of you from all the time we spent together anyways i am hitting the sack later son
you are going to take me seriously right
i wanna trash talk your ass so hard right now but i truly pity you at the moment so i canât one day you might be fed up with such a life when that happens you will motivate urself
it was just crude trash talk aint nothing serious
it is on the berlin wall right if that is the case we can certainly visit it it was part of the plan
ya it honestly aint we can do whatever
how do we send stuff to cargo do we just check it in
yo when are you gonna get to the airport
yeah
ok
you bet yo ass you will
i gave you explicit instructions in the group chat but you had to get it from the machine first
oh ok but you need to get boarding pass before putting your bag for checkin nigger before you get on the plane i wanna see ur ass i will wait for you if you donât get here before boarding
yo nigger do you read this i thought nobody is actually sitting beside me but somebody actually is httpswwwbehancenetgalleries5architecturecontentprojectsqueues141
i think i will come
i looked it up and none of the public transit works now sorry i meant at 2am
ya we can setup for like 200am
yes
i donât see why you wanna arrive so early though
oh wait the international flights here takes longer to get to port ok i got the app it takes 30 min to get there from our house 330pm i meant
ok are you finished eating
i just booked for 245am
ready yo nigger come find me at tim horton
ok yo where are you and yo i just talked to your sister she talks like a confident girl i feel like she is way more coherent than either one of us
peter did more of that attacking
ya i did she couldnât my high level questions just like her boss answer
thatâs like all the whites she is white washed as fuck man and i just talked to tina i couldnât keep up with her pace of conversation
i see i am glad you guys are disciplining her correctly yo give me the email that you want me to etransfer i will take care of it tonight
yo man i sent you the money the answer is blackmother
it is a blackmother thats literally what it means
her trip to japan our trip her work my school related stuffs we ran out of things to talk about after that
nope
didnt bother asking her lol why are you curious
it would have been weird of me to ask her because i am not that into her personal life
she fucking hugged me when we met that was like some next level socialization
we didnt even hug the last time we saw each other but like every time i did it with some other girls they were weirded out by it so i am kind of traumatized from that
ok dude your sister makes me feel like i am inferior to her she got that super confident aura i guess she has changed over the past few years
ya i heard from her so yes maybe it is time to go and it is not difficult to study up on a field that you are interested in anyways i am going to sleep now man
yo i will talk to you tomorrow i am truly sleepy now
later
wtf since when did you do that
do you remember that clearly in your head
ok
ok am i still your friend if i donât get it after seeing it
lol i was actually gonna guess that gg
that password is literally what it means i donât know why you didnât understand it
nigger how is your ass doing in med school you getting pummelled down and you got to read this short manga man you can finish it in like 10 minutes httpbrasscockroachcomh4ll0w33n2007mangaamigarafullamigarahtml
that is unfortunate but you spent like 2 years in school the fuck did you learn from there
that is pretty much what i had expected what you had expected oh well you will make the best of your situation at least you can go home and review your shit everyday when you dont understand something
how much are you working though
you got time man review some shit and make use of it next time you need it which presumably isnt that long off you might feel good about yourself and that can be a huge motivational boost
it is manga bullshit this time
i dont know but you can finish it in like 10 minutes and you read faster than i do
haha ya thats the thing
it doesnt scare you no more this one i just sent you is a weaker version of that the scary factor comes from the obsessive nature of the characters i gotta go now so talk alter
ya like it was vanilla it was an interesting twist though no pun intended you sent a photo dude check this shit out son she is actually not that hot after checking out her face you sent a photo
well they are not meant to be super obvious but in the first one i thought at first the girl in pink looked hot
i am just trying to settle down
well i just worked the whole day after just arriving last night good for you son you are gonna survive that shit tina and tommy aint got nothing on your mad skill son no japanese pussies at least
they are all foreigners
and when i say work all day i meant 10  5 international students
haha maybe i dont know
wtf why
i mean there aint no girls looking for d here neither i have to go outside this circle to find them
lol why do you say that
so dont the girls over there need sex
right nvm
lets see if you are right
show dem de wae
alright son you take care of your ass tell tommy and tina i said hi tell them that i believe in your ass
it is very sweet of you to ask but i am fine here how are you doing son
why the fuck do you call him preceptor
lol
ya that is one of those information that makes you think hard
how do you know they are not attractive
especially the girl
from like uoft oh ok right of course
the only thing that matters is her ass when you are fucking you are not looking at her face that much when you are fucking
ya like the adrenaline o the moment kind of makes you wanna keep fucking regardless of how hot they are i think
i am gonna make some friends here in japan and see where things go
that is my only chance of survival gg
hopefully coming down here will make me more socially active that is honestly a very useful skill to take back to canada if i actually manage to get it
ya you can
i already do lol but hopefully not with new people
anyways i gotta sign off to go to work almost time here
actually i got a few more minutes to chat here
wtf is that reddit
gg son
like she was academically excellent while being a pro gymnast
makes you feel how much time you wasted in your life lol
i guess so was she white
you think she got a boy friend i mean
there are fishes out there man
how are her body sizes
the fuck baggy clothes
yo why donât you show me who she is
ya she does look old but her sizes are good and now i finally got to go
so i will chat with you later man tonight i am going to karaoke
coworkers invited anyways later nigger whats your status
thatâs your dream thoguh is it not nigger i just got matched with a jap girl here on tinder and she can speak english lol wish my ass luck son
nigger how is your ass doing
gg
dude that is how we do shit around here man
the positive feedbacks are honestly just like winning a magic game and it is an external response too
so two days ago i did an all night hike to reach mt fuji top and i did but unfortunately we couldnt see the sunrise cuz it was too fucking cloudy
ya i know lol
dude it is honestly not worth it it was super tiring and the whole trip costed me like lots of money
yes
like close to 100 and i just remembered i have to pay somebody back
the hike was steep as fuck 10 fucking hours son and the downward hike was 5 hours
yes
i would lose my breath very rapidly when i was climbing up i had to take lots of breaks
coworkers from canada i didnt feel super sick or anything but just that i got super tired rapidly because i just wasnt used to climbing that much
my coworkers were a lot more athletic
well not yet but i am trying to expand my social sphere so i can get to that stage i dont have the skill to do pickup yes the dress up helps a lot
and yo man you gotta hear this shit about my workplace i took a look at his problem for a few moments yesterday and i gave him some direction
all i am trying to say is that felt fucking good
i truly am man i am probably the smartest motherfucker they ever had in here
ya of course son i aint gossiping about this shit or none
nah i dont think my past experiences apply here i was always humble on the surface in the workplace i only ever talk about this shit with close people
there are only 2 girls from canada in my workplace and they aint super hot or nothing but i sure would like to bang one of them because she is this nicest sweetest and positive human being i have ever met
but i honestly dont think i got any chance with her her name is justine pepin
cant find her on facebook
but honestly she is not hot just wholesome pretty but she has a thing for the guy sitting beside me so i got no chance with her the n00b i was talking to you about earlier
anyways son i am gonna get to work now i will talk to you later i look forward to hearing more from you about your work sounds like you can ride this hype to victory
nigger you better be here when i tell you this shit i just went on a date with this incredibly pretty japanese girl and the result was fucking good it is the same girl i told you last time
nah it was just traditional dating i basically talked the whole time and she enjoyed talking to me
she is a document translator in the field of finance she is supposedly the best english  japanese translator in her firm or something
lol find what ojb i aint interested in a job in that area but anyways man dating her will be real slow
she was using tinder to find friends apparently and she was so conservative that she didnt want to put any of her information on it except of a shot of her body without her head
i aint for sure
i straight up asked her if i got any chance with her
i mean i aint got no other choice for now i am swiping right like mad on tinder and i aint matching with anybody thing is i think she is pretty and she got a nice figure
she only got one online and it is a shot of her body without her head
dude i fucking met her irl
well here she is discouraged from her friends to put too much information probably because of some cultural shit
but honestly the main thing is that she said she had the intentino of looking for friends which wasnt what i wanted
well before that i got to even find a fucking date and this was the first one anyways i think i will give up on this shit all together soon because i just aint getting matched
i read on an online forum some guys had a good run on tinder in japan even though they are foreigners
lol man nobody likes the fucking asianamericans fuck this shit just fuck this shit
unless you are completely white washed
or just exhibit qualities that white girls like anyways man i am gonna hit the sack now
well i think that is enough there are plenty of white ladies who have a relationship with asians who are far from dominant culture so they probably exhibited some kind of traits that made them attractive anyways later
great stuff son looking forward to it nigger i literally owe you my life man these pictures are insane unfuckingbelievable they are making me look like god like holy shit
ok good man
ok
wait how the fuck do you know she liked you
oh shieeeet you cant undo it
gg son you gotta pay some money now and talk to her
paying money can let you chat with her possibly
do you have her photo
rosey
she sounds like kind of out of your comfort zone man
ya for sho son
lol you were swiping people as you wake up from bed or are you all nighting for your med
oh ok lol
short doesnt matter man fat is a problem
well yes everything that is worth doing is full of failures
later man
yes i am around nigger
ok
i like the second one better
the streak of street light looks nice
nigger what do you think about this girl you sent a photo she apparently does modelling but her highest level of education is high school would you tap that here is another one you sent a photo
dude i was just curious of your thought we havenât matched yet nigger i need you to make haste with them europe photos how are they coming along
i might watch that shit again lol
even on weekends dude
that is fucked up
well good luck with that shit son i will be worth it in the end
i am slacking off pretty hard nowadays during break but work is going well
ainât got none yet i was thinking though i should pay some money to so some research like who gets the most likes from girls and just copy what they do
i am not gonna fake it i will research and understand why it works for others
well i think you can make yourself look good
ya do that man
well nigger i also got the same experience on tinder i swiped right 100 for like 2 weeks and i get nothing if you wanna fuck girls on dating apps you work out and make yourself look strong
itâs hard to work out
well lemme tell you son you are a worthless piece of shit if you donât go to gym so you better get ur ass in there
ya you need to so when are you gonna give me them photos you gotta boost your photo game in dating apps
yes they looked really good and yes i am slaying dat japanese pussy i friended a japanese girl in a meetup recently so it will be interesting where things go
you sent a photo you sent a photo dude check out these love hotels man i couldnât get their price on the photo but it was like 2800 yen for 1 hour
i think you have to bring your own
i didnt go in and check in hindsight i should have done that
they are not hard to find lol
i mean you wont ever be able to get them
well they are no good if you cant get the mood up to a sexual level and you cant do that
lol well these things got not practice requirements they just come to you naturally
if you dont have it then you aint got it for life and yes indeed you are stuck
oh by the way 2800 yen is like 32 in cad actually more like 345
i mean thatâs what you expect in canada but knowing japan they probably do a good job keeping it clean
why the fuck you talking about son
maybe china
but love hotel is not really a whoreâs place you literally rent that shit with your girlfriend but anyways that wasnât your point
you wonât be able to find that in love hotel neither unless the dried ones that nobody detects except
i suppose so nigger wtf are you doing now
lol is that like for your to cope with the stress
the game
yo nigger how would you write a 200 word essay on what makes me unique i want to write it around my diverse cultural background and my experience working in graduate study before going back to school to study engineering
i already took care of it thanks man
lol son i aint got nothing on that hotel beds yet i wish there comes a day when my load gets on that bed
if i get a wife then yes i will be
dude by the way it took me like an entire fucking day to write a 600 word essay i cant fucking call that efficient i think somebody like you would dish that shit out in highquality rapidly
ok that makes me feel better you sent an attachment a lot of it is actually similar to what you edited for the japan application but of course there are new parts too thanks in advance buddy
hey thats cool in the gang you take ur time son yo what do you think about this music written by some amateur httpssoundcloudcomalgorhythmaibaroquefantasy
it was good to listen to when i am studyinh is when i first read your messages i thought they were addressed to my cover letter and i was like daaamn that was harsh dude lol just woke up
highly doubt it with the current technology
how do you do that on your phone
what does it do exactlyâ
ok that is hardly an ai drawing though
yes thatâs shat i was thinking about still a long way off until we get creative ais
yes we got at least 40 more years on this planet we will see the first robot before we die
sentient ones or creative ais at least
and definitely some form of humanoid ai
you need that shit
no
lol what
the fuck is that shit
wtf is mtg arena
like cock
and its free
hey that ainât so bad
well maybe yo remember that girl you told me to give up on from tinder cuz she is only looking for friends she just asked me out for a friendly dinner lol
i highly doubt it but i am going anyways going to a yakiniku place and i love that shit
jap bbq
lol she doesnât seem the type you motherfucker trolling my nigger ass
wait so you are saying it could mean that she doesnât want thr d in east culture
ok well i am gonna treat her like a gentleman fucking ainât everything about relationships like how be west makes us believe like damnwest is culture of fuck
ok course
honda girls are pretty but this one isnât it
i ainât got no chance man they eat in their own corners i donât speak their language that well
one of them is married and another one seems to be dating another canadian in the workplace
and the other girl doesnât really like me that much so there ainât nothing left
it is for certain students
they certainly love that shit maybe that is why i am going to dinner with a girl tonight but i also know lots of westerners they come here and it is easy for them to fuck so easy
they ainât like us man they spent their life enjoying dealin with people so they got good people skill
you bet your nelly there are there was an annoucement in my area that a middle school boy ran away from home after killing his grandfather and critically injuring his grandma with a knife it is still going on
well they are more civilized most certainly but this kind of stuffs happen a lot more often here because kids go through a range of difficulties and they donât have a good way of expressing them to other people and to get help
you know i want myself some crazy ass japanese psycho bitch like that japanese girl from kill bill
i love taking advantage of their paychological instability
lol itâs a fucking joke dude
lol dude since when did you become so funny you can tell her that we had this convo and that i didnât have any regrets
nah she will be happy that i will leave behind an offspring somewhere in this world thatâs what chinese families want right
my parents are cool with jap
i donât know lots of chinese watch anime especially younger generation so at least in the future there will be lots of friendship all this hatred shit will be forgotten in like 20  30 years from now
fuck you nigger
which government are you referring to the japanese
so people donât hate japanese but just not their policy
is that like your opinion or the truth because i heard most of the conflict between jap and chin comes from contemporary disputes
i mean those who take that issue seriously are like old timers
but they never experienced it personally it is hard to hate something that they are only taught from texts
i mean germany owned that shit up real hard
well you know what it is acceptable to the country as long as they are not threatened by their inaction if you wait long enough for people to forget about the bad things you did everything will go back to normal
i mean lots of people in society practice that
but 911 wouldnât have as much impact in our memory  in like 50 years from now
no but we are caring less about it i certainly donât give a shit i got bigger problems to worry about
dude i know it is a huge issue but i am just putting the emphasis on the reality of the situation that people forget shits or has less impact
i mean nothing will be forgotten as long as written in text
her parents spent like some 2 million on her education every year for a few years and this is in dollars she wants that money
nah i make my gold i donât dig them i am a fucking alchemist
you bet your nelly dude by the way how is your ass doing in school
no pain no gain son
you are becoming stronger everyday by tanking the stress and pain
whatever doesnât kill you will die yo do you got time to look over my cover letter
you mean next friday negro you need to watch the film hardcore henry 2015 that film is better than kill bill
yo dont worry about it i already submitted
i didnt wanna wait until next friday and i thought the cover letter was good enough i didnt want to have this extra load of thing hanging in my head so i took care of it
anyways i was just watching youtube and i came across a comment about hardcore henry when i was watching a doom 2005 scene ya no problem have you seen it
hardcore henry right dude that film is fucking insane it is basically made by a russian director who wanted to make a film version of fps games and boy did they deliver on that shit
i actually like it i played dishonored in 2012 i wish i had a good enough computer to play dishonored 2 and i watched the playthrough of wolfenstein wish it could be run on mac but it didnt
i dont wanna use bootcamp on this too much hassle
yo i wanted to play half life and then go onto 2 but hf1 literally gave me headaches when i was playing it on mac efficiently
ok i will try that then
i wont have time for elder scolls for now but i wanna play hf when i have time
and you gotta watch fucking hardcore henry that film is a literal bomb man it got humor and over the top action and it is a revenge story
nigger i need to ask you for advice i just got a job interview with a hot shot at princess margaret hospital on friday if he offers me the job right away on the spot would it be ok for me to stall the offer temporarily to see what other jobs i get from my other applications
i am gonna have a skype interview i just started applying to other jobs and i am optimistic that i can get interviews with other places but the other purely engineering jobs will get me close to sweaty dudes
ya
every time i do science i feel like i have to grind through inconsequential data interpretation yo elon musk went to queenâs university cuz he heard there are hot white girls there when he was in undergrad of course
for summer internship so coop
yes
i still got like 2 more years of courses
it is like life science undergrad after i return to canada
and they got to interview other people as well
alright sir
and ditch their dumbasses if i find something more attractive
dude i will say no and stall the consequence of that is worse than saying no dude sorry saying yes
yo i ainât that into game design now
working at unity is purely engineering
unity themselves donât make games they support people who do i think i have the option of going into bio comp if i want to but that is not my ambition
right wow them first then decide
i have this bad habit of thinking too far ahead i need ur smart ass to rein me in sometimes
so i appreciate it
appreciate your advice i meant the fuck is being red
oh right
so i ainât that blue after all
lol nicooool i will pull some cruel ultimatums when i deal with people
yo that is literally what i fantasize like i often fantasizing telling the interviewees that i am the best candidate you will ever get and i am gonna use your resource like urzaâs mine and they will be thankful
to be honest i havenât met any of that shit since i started in this new degree
ya i am honestly too fucking intense and confident those freshmen ainât got shit on me
thanks for reeling me in som son
talking to me will help man
i mean you probably doused yourself with some of that just now
i think you just watch confident people behave and you will be confident yourself or maybe this is genetic anyways son i am gone now i will chat with you later and good night to you
by the way nigger i never knew about queenâs reputation for having hot girls and goddamn these professionally dressed japanese ladies look fine nigger you are into neuroscience right
you a pro you know how brain works
you know anything about perception and the neuro mechanisms for it and congrats by the way on owning up the neuro lecture ur the guy for me
what are some well known theories you have learned about senses have you ever heard about predictive coding theory
hmm ok so you have done some high level stuff not much of basic neuro
i donât need to know any specific things just fishing for ideas
so like i realized that neuroscience models work extremely well in the context of ai task all of major developments in machine learning recently were inspired by neuroscience you sent a photo you sent a photo
dude you ainât got no engineering skill how are u gonna do this in the future
hahaha that is exactly right son how much are you gonna charge you can show your brother some love right
it is good and all that you would do this for fun but you would be surprised at how much people would pay an expert neuroscientist for consulting to create a humanlike ai
you would be a doctor but doctor is kind of like an expert in those scientific knowledge though right
honestly your knowledge in science wouldnt be grounded unless you practice it in the laboratory you would just know it but you wont have any conviction on your knowledge if people try to disprove it
yo nigger i want to ask you a neuroscience question how does a person come up with a sentence lets say when you get hit by a car the guy would shout i got hit by a car
yo nigger thanks for your answer man i am gonna process it in my mind to see what the implications for them are
i see that is un fucking fortunate i guess thats why nobody can make speech generating ai right now people understand visual cortex quite well so there are a lot of deep learning ai that can process visual information
how is your ass doing man are you in the hospital right now
dude it sounds serious are you ok
it ainât a thing man but i think you can fight through that shit
i am starting to have a bit of fun cuz got a few things lined up this week and next like travelling to osaka today i am going down to town on a dinner with some young locals
but work basically didnât progress at all this week so i am a little frustrates in that
so like i met this really cute girl a while back that i wanted to fuck in a meetup we chatted a bit and she invited me to this dinner she organized with her friends
she ainât looking for a boyfriend so i only got one option if i wanna fuck her up you got any luck over there man
well it would be nice to have that ainât it
when do you have a break officially
i wonât see you then unfortunately
but maybe you can build up an online relationship before you get back i am never there for a while
you have convos with these girls right
you should chat more with them take some chances are they hot girls
lol there is nothing uncomfortable chatting with a person who is 200 km away from you
even better
like you just lack energy or you just donât wanna pretend
haha do it up son i gotta get my ass out of bed so i will chat with you later
my nigger man how is your ass doing in medicine
lol dude do you play with your boys in house
good to hear that meng is pretty toxic at times he is a provacateur as well yo i came here needing an advice from you or just your opinion some shit
so like when i first came to japan i thought i should get social with the locals so i was desperatly looking for things to do like teaching english or 5 or so
ya i am trying not to as well i am currently looking for a replacement for her and there are definitely people who are far more qualified to do the presentation than me
did i tell you about my trip to osaka i met up with my childhood friends and they turned out to be incredibly good amateur mahjong players you sent 2 photos this was the resort
lol not really dude this was just a fantastic place but i will say japan is probably the best place to enjoy yourself in this world and i have experienced some of that
you can once you clear your debts
when is that gonna happen man honestly it is only worth coming here if you amass big wealth cuz even the medium priced stuff here isnât all that fancy unless
well i ainât in debt at least i got a bit of surplus and i donât use my money for much of anything
you gotta come here before japan is submerged in water that can happen in a few years with global warming and shit
i havenât found none of that here so far but maybe itâs cuz i havenât tried hard enough
ya but now that you mention i might give it a try
ok son thanks for your opinion on my personal matter
ya sure
by the way i decided to work for uhn during summer so you gotta come visit you sent 2 photos by the way i created a harem over here in japan
yes hopefully i also get to meet some girls there nigger are you playing dota over the break
when does your break start
lol
i will download it today
my ping will be shit but hopefully i can be of use to your team
your words do me honor
it might not be that bad but we will see i played on bad ping on garena before this is nothing new for me
lol it doesnât feel like yestersay to me but yes time has changed everyday we only get more regretful of missing past opportunities
i am still working but this is a long weekend i work from like 7pm  4am toronto time
i mean when are you playing today
i am downloading now and it will be ready in 2 hours and yes saturday morning arenât your buddies also playing
yo so are your buddies playing as well
ok hopefully i get to play with some of them today
are you playing at your house doesnât your parents rage about that shit
lol your dad went back to china huh is he working there permanently
nice
i got 50 min left
nah man plane ticket too expensive
this entire summer man
awesome dude we gonna feast up when you come back get together with good ol pete
whats the problem
yo i finished the first season of got two days ago yo where the fuck are you nigger when do you wanna play today
ok no problem man nigger when you are ready let me know i am watching got2
ok letâs go to town
are your boys online
ya i would love to man
nigger lemme urge you to go for the neurosurgeon option for medicine 21st century is the century of the brain in addition to working in hospitals you will have an entire neurorelated tech industry that you have the opportunity to work in if you master this field it will be infinitely more exciting than internal medicine
oh ok then possibly choose that but what is the mobility in specialty in medicine can you switch around easily
unfuckingfortunate
hehehe ups and downs ya medicine has some of that every career has that dude game of throne is like one of the most fucked up shit i have ever seen in my life
it is the same reason why i recommend you a lot of great anime but you almost never watch them the first 3 or 4 episodes of season two has sex scenes in every episode
yo what are you doing on the night of friday to sunday
dotes nigger
nah i ainât got time son i am working and i ainât got time tomorrow neither it will have to be saturday night if you are interested in playing that day
nigger are we playing today
ya that aint no problem son where the fuck you at nigger
lol it is 1130 over there that is a pretty big party
lol i am playing a game now but let me know when you are ready
ok
i got a date with a jap girl
wait to be honest this is more of a desperation date based on her profile she sounds like somebody who i will not get along with later but i am going anyways just to check her out
ya that too
oh ok how old are they
i donât know you sent 3 photos the reason why i am skeptical is that she smokes  and on her profile she mentions she doesnât want kids
it helps if i can take her seriously i will have to constantly remind myself to be not serious otherwise
ya unfortunately this turns a lot of people off from me i prefer my interaction to be free of jokes that need wit
i think she vapes those pictures look like vape
vaping will unlikely to have the burnt smell of cigarette what is your schedule looking like for the next few days
that and others are you starting class on monday
oh ok then we might still got some nights for dota possibly
i ainât for sure yet we planned for like in 3 days she is real busy these days she is doing a hackathon foe the weekend
i think i need to cut down on the dark jokes in my profile yes
i ainât for sure man
what is her name can i find her on fb
are you for fucking real jesus our boy gordon
what is he doing now career wise
what kind of engineer civil
i see i am still very far away from buying condo at this moment
let alone buying a condo with a gf that could take years
do you have anything new on relationships
have you ever felt like you should work on yourself more before you go for higher fruits i donât mean this in an offensive way but did this ever cross your mind
there will continue to be even after you graduate from medicine and even after you start residence
but why now though
i feel like we are missing something in interacting with girls we wouldnât be having so much trouble if we are normal people we need to take time to figure out what that is
beauty is not the only problem i am referring to it is just dating status some girls are worth more than others
but yes precisely dating is like finding a job
i believe we are otherwise we wouldnât be having so much trouble
well i canât tell you because i donât know what your situation is and i donât know enough about what others want to give a good answer but that doesnât mean we are not missing anything
how can you say that we are not missing anything it is definitely unclear
i mean there is a reason why we are having so much trouble we just donât know what that reason is honestly
well i want one now so i can build relationship
having exs isnât an accomplishment
it gives you experirnce for sure without them i wouldnât know what i am missing or what i want out of a relationship you might have some trouble with your first girlfriend
lemme tell you what though i think it is fairly easy to say that both of us needs to work on our confidence
confidence doesnât always have to make you stand out but it should allow you to do act without inhibition when it matters the most
i feel like i can just learn a lot more about your social tact i am not sure if that is accurate but that is just my impression and you obviously dont like confrontations
of course cuz you dont need to worry about the wrong message
honestly if people found peacefulness sexy then you would be getting pussies everyday but our primal instinct tells us that those who can assert their dominance are worth mating with
confrontation isnt the only aspect like you mentioned before you dont like to get emotionally invested in girls because you dont want to send the wrong message but why do you got to worry about the wrong message
no but you should treat the girls like you treat your beloved brothers
i mean if they get creeped out it is their issue is it not as long as you are treating them like you treat your guy friends
it is hard to go in for the kill on your actual target if you cannot get it on with normal girls
ya it is
it frustrates me that i cant figure this shit out
honestly i thought it would be plentiful in your area
cuz you are in med school and shit
right
i think you will be in temporary geographic location for a very long time cuz you said you might not match at toronto and you will always try to come back to toronto
i dont know if ottawa counts as a permanent location but at least it is a place with plenty of girls if i look hard enough
yes there are asian girls in ottawa
but it is mostly white girls for sure
the thing is though white girls in general will not be compatible with my life style
haha yes you are in a terrible spot
i think you might like to search for international students they could be good if they are actually here to learn and not the rich kids who are sent by their parents
my exs were both like that and they are quite good if you are a good match
you know alice zhang she couldnt speak english very well 8 years ago but recently i chatted with her and honestly you cant tell whether she was from china or from here
what do you mean you doubt that
oh that is right
we were only talking surface level stuff so maybe you are right there is nothing wrong with being picky but you need to put in the effort to get those who you are interested in
i am not going to tell you to settle for less because once you do you will regret it for your entire life what do you have to do to achieve that
well that is pretty much what all of us want but do you think a white girl who is hot smart and successful would want to date someone like you now
it is not meant as an offense thatâs just how it is
aside from your skin color and culture
but you canât change them
so it is meaningless to think about them
start with that first that is easy to focus on and easy to achieve it is also good for your health in general
it hasnât been for me so i am saying it is easy i wish i was there for you man if i was i would take you to gym everyday
ya you got to go son i guess you could think of that as a challenge
if you canât muster the discipline to go to gym then you dont deserve those successful pretty white girls
it is definitely straightforward
ya man i would die to be in your position but everyday you are wasting it away so you got to learn to put in the extra effort
i am going out in the morning today unfortunately
whats your plan for tomorrow though you got stuffs to do at night or morning
ok man that could be good then
yes yes
nigger it is weird seeing you use nonverbal texts like we have been chatting with pure texts for a very long time but then again i am using emojis and shit nowadays
yes
lol oh ok gg
you see non asians use it too girls use the shit out of emojis fucking goddamn
lol yes i donât need no confusing signs of fucking flirtatious shits world is already confusing as it is swim suit would be very direct and welcoming
no only in porns
i will go to okinawa during spring though
so i might see some nice swimsuit girls
well i come across those porn occasionally
but really though i havenât seen any girl wear like one of those full body swim suit in porn
in japanâs convenience store they sell gravure model mags so those might have them in fact i am confident they do but you definitely see lots more swim suit pr0n in hentai that shit is commonly place
i will talk to you later in a language xchange nie now
nigger are we playing today
i am now nigger
alright
negro i am doing fine son i watched joffrey die i got canât wait to be back in canada dude how about you son
this place is just simply not my destiny i realized after i came here i have a greater role to play in society when i go back to canada while japan is a  stagnating country
2020 nigger
i hope you will be happy
the world ainât got much of it nowadays absolutely you just need confidence and strength and know the right people what specifically are you worried about by the way
lol dude and you are that 23
i wouldnât recommend you to think about it you just have to do what you need to do
dude forget about the statistics
you were never the best student in undergrad neither but you made it happen
yes thatâs right so do it again
i know medicine ladies who is like 36 and not married you being delayed in dating ainât a big deal and look for
i am saying that all hope is not lost you can satiate your thirst now if you have the ability to do so which it sounds like you have none
so you might as well use that time to boost your attractiveness
yes baby steps you donât wanna be that guy who has python for arms by age 30
i donât know man just donât be that guy
i am working in an hour dude i am surprised you have time for that are you on break or something
of course you are yo i wanna know what your exact schedule is these days just out of curiosity like how hard are you working
ok
do you work everyday
dude that is like a lot more relaxing than i thought
well ok do you do studying after work
yo i am gonna study every fucking day after i finish work so that i can say to myself i am working harder than you
technical skills in the industry i am already doing that
lol why though
comparing yourself to others
maybe he studied more thoroughly they
i mean there is concrete reward for studying now because you are presenting your answers in front of an audience so i imagined that you would be more motivated to study
it is time to get that shit back man
your motivation you said you gave it up
so it is gg then
but like dont you also realize you can be proer than those niggers if you actually put work into it
right that is fair but i guess that will be gg for you forever
it is a draw
lol yes
i am glad you are going to the gym now
ya at this point i feel like taking an unconventional path is the only way that i can live i am sick and tired of listening to other people telling me what to do when they dont know what they are doing
ya i will sustain myself well enough
i can guarantee that day will come for both of us it will just take time
you just gotta work hard and believe that it will pay off and have the confidence that you deserve residency in a good city you need that shit man
it sort of can it makes you more active active in decision making i mean i am gonna brush my teeth brb
yo if you wanna play dota this weekend let me know ahead of time so i can download it
see your father huh the legend is back home
gotta give him a welcome still he came back from hard work in china that country is going to shit i heard
you should learn chin though it will be useful in the future i am gone for work now talk later son
you sent a photo yo check out that side boob man
the fuck you got something better she my facing my way earlier and boy you wish you were in my position
guess not this one was stationary so it could be easily captured
well yes not the first time i did it
well i was actually watching something on my iphone when i saw the opportunity i only just shifted my iphone slightly to take that photo so i am sure not many people noticed in fact nobody
i love taking them photos of good sceneries
the sight here is like damn son it is an incredibly peaceful country but the people here are too respectful
all of them if you want cityscape only tokyo has it i havent travelled much in japan honestly and i dont need to tell you about the girls here dude i find old ladies in my fucking office sexy
my work is actually 10 minutes walk from my house so i dont experience that daily mad rush on the train
oh yes all arranged i feel like my supervisor is a real pushover though he pretty much listens to everything i tells him occasionally he gives me advice
lol real answer lol they are so fucking pro
i sometimes feel bad for you son that you have to suck up to these people
it absolutely is
so i have been very considerate in my communication with him i am gonna go cook myself some food
lunch is like 5 and dinner ends up being slightly cheaper than that if you make your own but a good meal can cost you less than 8 for dinner that is and i think that is fairly cheap
i cook mostly curry and japanese stew sometimes i cook very quick hotpot
nah they are easy shit like right now i am gonna cook hotpot and the dipping that i use is this sauce called ponzu that is made of soy sauce with citrus juice it is delicious
yes i am down
nah i dont appreciate it lol but i do appreciate you sharing it is pretty much accepted in the anime community that characters dont reflect their age this is hardly remarkable
they also got these loli looking girls who are like 30 years old
ya i got you son dude you need to fucking watch or play soma i have been telling you for ages man this game will blow your mind
ok yo i wanna ask you a question about medicine is there any ethical concern with uploading annoymous medical data online for the purpose of research
i seethe person that i will be working for this summer mentioned something about sharing ct scan data for the public so i was thinking about the prospect of a business involving this type of material
how is it shared between people
so that is incredibly cumbersome because you have to go to different peoples website to get different data
ya its alright
have fun son httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzbrvietrce
this scene is ridiculous in numerous levels first of all tywin is wearing incredibly modern clothing i mean the nigger is practically wearing a tshirt
lol fuck that shit
dude this whole scene is a fucking joke
it is just not the tshirt the nigger was wearing a fucking modern pants a fucking slim fit dude
but not his sons
ya cuz they want to keep in fashion of that age
honestly those are not convincing arguments but its cool this convo is innocuous
who said that the directors i am not disliking this scene but everybody on the internet is oblivious it seems
that was in the interview or some shit
well i am not surprised if it didnât make the final cut because of his overexaggerated senility that killed the scene i tell you
alright sure i got you man tywinâs actor is a fucking boss he never smiles happily
shae acts like a good whore thougj
she reminds me of my ex
thatâs how good she is
lol but seriously though shaeâs behavior reminds me so much of my ex her mannerism and the way she betrayedtyrion later at the trial
lol i didnât fucking know is her accent real
maybe grrm likes her because he never had the experience of writing a good whore before and he out did himself with shae
whatever man i am gonna later tell my ex this character reminds me of her that will be fun
i mean she already blocked me on fb so she already burned bridge right there but unfortunately for her she forgot about wechat so many girls have burnt bridges with me i donât give a fuck no more
change what i cant change their personalities one of them just suddenly blocked me on facebook after she got slightly upset with something i said
i mean maybe not countless but many
well no but you got to try
oh ya recently the girl that i was supposed to go on a date with never replied back after she mentioned she can meet on a specific date
well there is only one way left man that is to become super attractive and make them come to me
dude grrm was inspired by pulp fiction
what game of thrones is a good show of course i am a fan
but you know why i say he was inspired by pulp fiction right
pulp fiction was the first movie to popularize killing someone while taking a shit killing someone who is taking a shit
1994 got came out in 1996
lol dude grrm was trying to tell the viewer that things can change rapidly from just taking a shit but man the weakness tywin showed in that episode was delicious but honestly pathetic as well
oh i am when i try dude this guy looks like a younger version of charles dance you sent a photo
yes dota2
dude this is too good
negros these guys know it
he looks like chairman mao yo nigger do you believe in intersectionality
it is a belief that workplace should accomodate different minorities like you should treat an indian  female doctor differently from a white female doctor or give special attention to a gay programmer than nongay
ya it is so complex that nobody can give a good example on the internet
i applied for a conference where they celebrate women in tech one of the application questions was how do you promote intersectionality in workplace so that got me really thinking because to me intersectionality is full of crap
nope i am just there to hit on girls
dude i already did i pretty much refuted intersectionality but anyways do you got anything on this topic
well maybe it was foolish but i couldnât do any better i am not used to bullshitting do you have an example of how intersectionality can help workplace nigger check this shit out httpswwwsciencedailycomreleases201901190129081919htm
i am interested in braincomputer interface it is also related to my field because the only way to interpret brain electric activity is through ai
well i hope you achieve your dream and i finished season 6 of got things are finally starting to pick up pace for the starks
a man enjoys watching his favorite characters be badasses and cersei reminds a man of his own mother
you havent seen my mother when she is crazy she would literally go berserk when she doesnt get the things she want my mother is also not as smart as she thinks she is which is precisely what tywin told her she is also purely driven by emotion which is actually what a lot of girls are like but especially true for my mother and the way she berates jaime is precisely the way she berates my father unreasonable and harsh which once again is precisely a common trait that many women possess
all people can be like that but it is a trait i observe very commonly in women especially chinese women
well cersei reminds me of my mother but not my father for a reason it doesnât matter if all people can be like that my mother is like cersei thatâs all that matters
yes thats right and she is fierce as fuck stannis is dead boy and he got destroyed by himself
wait what damn son
so they changed that much huh now i can understand why you say the book might be better
i got low attention span you know reading books takes too much attention
shame shame shame books are also dying i believe with the world becoming more digital less people will spend time reading stories from books they got memes to keep up on from youtube and facebook
ya i dominated that shit ez
there werent any tricks all stuffs discussed in lectures
i dont remember exactly but there are some for loops that you have to spend some time on it was all multiple choice
yo fuck this quiz man its just 15 if you do badly just accept it and do better next time
because of your pressure to succeed
what is the source of your anxiety
for most people it is the pressure to succeed that stresses them out something external like parental demands or the need to get a good grade to get a good job
i dont think it is a big deal to be honest after a few more quizzes like this you wont give a fuck anymore
there are a few ways you can purposefully fail a test or two that way you are forcing yourself to not take the tests seriously you can also hang around people who are low stress and relaxed like me
6 years in university will do that to you but i am sure you will stop feeling the pressure after a while you just entered univerisity and everything is still fresh how was the quiz by the way
i got the white one
ok
you ó° yo can you ask your friend to send you the list of questions he did for engmec dgd this week the questions on friction
i owe you one buddy
alright thanks
you ó°
jesus i will try to look at the notes i took in class then thanks for your help
nah its alright
simple summing list question no binary
12 i believe
if it is dynamic then no
i have no idea what is chapter 12
i actually have no idea man i wasnt in the last few dgds maybe you should study it just in case
sorry couldnt help but chp12 does seem like something we learned in class mostly the centripetal accelearation stuff
i already got it but i appreciate your feeling yo son have you studied for ceg2136
jesus midterms all around hey have you talked with alex yet about the event
he sent us an email about meeting up a while back but i completely ignored the email didnt realize until just now that he wanted to meet
what hey whats up i might need to ask you a favor
do you do any type of assembling eletrical parts together in or out of class i am interested in knowing what an electrical engineerâs workshop looks like
do you use the workshops in school
how about in your labs
when do you have your labs is it in the same room as the ceg lab
ok i am trying to get a picture for a messy engineer desk for my modelling project
ya thats what i thought too do you know when they are open
alright thanks for the info buddy
oh thanks you sent an attachment
i will look at it tomorrow
yo i read your resume and i can see that it improved a lot from yesterday that being said i still think it needs a lot of improvement mostly small things and a few more detail expansion
you are welcome son new kinds of sensors and use them in ways that never existed before i think this is still vague
so then you should say you are using potato to make a sensor and what kind of sensor is this light sensor sound sensor water sensor
dude then you gotta fucking say that that is huge like i guess you are describing the overall activity of your endeavor but it is better to mention specifically what you are doing right now get it
its cool man i aint telling you what to do lol i am just telling you how you should approach resume writing
ya volunteering for various causes and events i would like to see that exxpanded awarded deanâs scholarship for excellence and another scholarship for photography mention the exact amount of money you got
rest of the improvements are on formatting and grammatical convention contributed to open source projects not contributing gives more space to the blurb and you gotta be mindful about periods again and thats it from me
welcome son
lol i didnt know i couldnt bike there
thanks very much appreciated yo do you still remember your experience from first year physics
i wanna do an interview for an app that i am making the app is for physics education
i need to ask you a few questions face to face are you available anytime before friday
sure
right now i will meet you at crx at 4pm hey where are you
no problem man still waiting
come to 5th
i am at the same place where we met last time yo we are in class now we thought you already came here we waited for your ass
you were here before us
motherfucker
nope you want it now
i aint gonna sell it right now but i can sell it to you after exams or like after classes end
ainât for sur man this is the final version man httpstianrenwanggithubio check it out
surprised at what
it isnât due until 20th but are you sure you didnât just think that i wasnât capable of producing such a work
thanks man feels good to not disappoint
i am actually seriously considering taking that class for the next semester there is still a lot of space in that class
can you send me the course description
does the course let you take on projects you are interested in or do they got a specific project they want you to do
well i think i am gonna take it next semester regardless
saif told you that he wants to work on a business plan for the january competition right
if you guys end up making some progress on it let me take a look at the final version because if it is a good plan then i might expand on it during the gng course
well ya same here
the course
gng4120
ya you bet
what kind of projects
hmm so you are saying we should do some practice before we work on an ambitious project like gamification
you know what i agree with you i am encountering a lot of problems from the development side mostly due to my lack of experience the frustration experienced in development can also lead to other problems
what is interesting is that i know some people who just got out of high school and they are already on there way to deploying their first large scale game lemme know if you are taking gng4120
yo did you end up putting that idea you had in the game development club into a digital format
lol well i am looking forward to it let me know when you finish
well that is too bad
no is that what you are learning
it would be nice if you can master making web games from the last club meeting you seemed to be quite good at designing simple games
it is undergoing i might be able to get the core mechanics and stuff done by the end of the break and hopefully we will have a slew of levels ready quickly
thanks dude oh shit i still got to learn how to use blender i know somebody who is good at it so i might ask him to help me out
whats his background
ok has he been practicing writing though
lets try him out if we get there
ya i want to make a game design studio that is what i want at the moment but unexpected opportunities may arise in the future
if i get jobs i am not planning to taking my ideas to them jobs are mostly for skill building and earning money
haha ya not sure if you know aoubt the development story of portal
no whats the importance
man that is absolutely amazing
we are lucky to have valve in the industry they set a good example for all other game companies
if i get my ideas stolen i would want them to be stolen by valve cuz i think they actually know how to put them to good use
lol ya that would be fucking terrible yo i am gonna get back to work
let me know when you finish that level you made in the club
i have unhinged studio right now
slash screen
whats the importance of splash screen
alright the logo i have in my head for now is just an unhinged door or a door that is falling apart cuz the hinge is broken
great stuff well i think we are getting ahead of ourselves but glad you like it
yeh
alright lemme take a look
you will have to include more details obviously but i can remember the idea you presented
thanks for the work son
looking over it now what are the two green buttons on the left hand side of the second floor
what i dont get is how can those left buttons ever be pressed if they are blocked by the same walls that are controlled by those buttons
i remember there was a trick with the fast running monkey for the 2nd floor its not in your current level
take your time
later
there is only one section the one on monday 7pm  10pm
that is too bd bad its ok i will spearhead our idea in that course
no i never heard about it
do you visit it often
that will be valuable in the future
lol
i am reading the how to start your own game company yo by the way you ahve been in this university for 3 years how do you check your grades after the finals
my grades
man they still havent released anything for me its been more than two weeks for some of them have you gotten any for yours
damn and i wanted to use them for applying to jobs
do you speak french by the way
it jobs for now i highly doubt i can get into a game design company but i am willing to try anything for now
oh are you fucking serious do you have connections in this field
oh sweet i really appreciate it
cool sounds like youve been to places
computer is everywhere i shouldnt be surprised
yo this article was pretty damn useful
httpgamecareerguidecomfeatures1573howtostartyourgamecompany5php i guess i cant say it is useful since i havent put any of the advice to practice yet but i can see the merit behind it and i want to put some of these advice into practice
you mean the part about forming a team
oh for sure
and arts people too
crashing bars lol
do arts people in uottawa actually do industrial art
or do they study the history and theory of art
damn that is hella boring
you probably cant find an actual industrial art student unless you go to a college i know a few artists but they are not in ottawa yo are you from toronto
why were you in waterloo your parents live in toronto
i see so you currently live in waterloo
alright
haha hopefully that aint gonna be the case the advice about forming a team and testing out the teams dynamic and power in a game jam seemed really interesting
yo i actually think we should do that before we even form a company
in fact we already finished our first round of team testing the other day in the startup weekend
man i dont know about doing it again i am sick of competitions nowadays
what is pov
oh wait i got it
i think the money part is important but they should have stressed that at the beginning the money is necessary for survival but the way they talked about it made it sound like they wanted to get rich fast
dont blame you the longer time you spend with something or someone you tend to realize their flaws but it is also important to commit yourself to the field even if you know its weaknesses commitment is important
thats pretty much it
you mean you need mental capital or stuffs like that nonmaterialistic things like relationships and education
right there isnt value in money if there is nothing valuable in the world
ya same here yo i am gonna get back to working on the game
later son
lol what the hell is this
this is an interesting solution and i would support it but i wonder why nobody has put this into practice yet
happy new year son
unity is life
yup thats why it is one of the most popular game editors it can make games in a lot of platforms
good luck man you should try then tutorials them
c is like java if you are taking iti again next semester then you should learn java
thats too bad
you ó°
lol c is like the mother of all object orientated language
let me check
i am in class a00 and lab a02
yo i think you meant iti1121 right
ya i can it aint a thang
yesterday i realized that i can demo my game is this thing i am going to on thursday so i started to frantically work on it this morning
cusec i dont know what it stands for but it is a gathering for college computer science students
ya
ya thats mostly the reason i am going
hopefully ya the thing is i dont think there are that many people i am not going in there with an expectation but will let the situation surprise me
no i mean this whole thing with gamification this game is undeniably targeted towards education even if we apply conventional game design concepts during the development
to be honest i am using this chance to demo mostly as a way to attract employers for any sort of it jobs
yup exactly
hmmm ya i mean anything is great at this point but we dont even have a game ready yet i guess dont do any media related things until we get an mvp
dont even have an mvp probably around 5
i am thinking about the game design and the programming at the same time and bugs always take me forever to fix and i have been going slow because there hasnt been a deadline
yes but i quickly rejected the idea
ya i want to practice programming during the development and i have no idea how flexible game maker is the kind of mechanics that i am aiming for might not be possible with game maker
unity was mostly a google recommended engine but it is recommended by google so there is some merit in that
is that right i dont think i will ever switch to game maker i already spent quite a bit of time on unity
sure as hell is yo i am gonna get back to work the thing with the market reserach is a good idea or rather our efforts might become redundunt
alright
later
it is interesting to look at what are considered to be educational games by other people its nice of you to have found this i never had the patience of looking for these things online
httpswwwlabstercom
i have things that i want to critique about this approach but the one thing it did perfectly was creating an immersive atmosphere
wish we had this expertise
they did this for vr i thought this was a computer game
lol looking at this makes me feel like i have already been defeated
yes indeed
that would be nice yes but it requires technologies beyond what we currently have
but i think i will have to address this issue during the market research how are we gonna beat the stuffs from labster do you know who are currently using labsters products
haha aint that nice goddamn it
afik what does that mean
oh is that right
there are a few things that i want to critique about their approach though i havent played the full simulation the simulation is a clicking game so it doesnt really capture that intricate component of working in a laboratory
i wouldnt be surprised if that is their goal
i am a little bit conflicted going through the simulation once doesnt seem to allow the student to remember everything they learned what do you think man
ya
the labster software does have its merit
so then what are we gonna do are we gonna continue with our plan
what do you mean by abstract concepts
problem solving you mean
right
i can see where you are going it is like taking that idea from that article you sent me you can teach programming without actually teaching coding
yo
i perfectly understand that it is unbusiness like of me to say this but i really wanna develop that cell biology video game even just for experimental purpose
right
haha i almost forgot that i am a complete n00b at making games
i wonder how far this labster stuff is gonna take over the market before we get good enough to compete
yo i believe that too that makes me arrogant lol i am sure every game developers thought that at some point in their careers
you dont enter this type of business without having some confidence in yourself
ya i wont be either man i am just afraid that reality will hit us in the face before we get there
yo thats exactly what i told my boss during my graduate study its just one of those things in life you love it so much that you gotta try it at least once
well aint you glad i went up there i nearly didnt pitch but you should have known that there are game dev companies you could have joined one of them
oh shit i forgot you are younger than me
i was also tunnel visioning on life science when i was in your time so i guess i shouldnt be surprised
24 you are 21 20
i think most people are like that there is nothing intrinsically interesting about money
people are starting to change though
i know a fewe business people who explicitly told me that they only entered business to make a living once they got something else that interest them they will quit
well i hope that does work out for you yo before i go work on the game do you know hwo to check the amount of money you need to pay uottawa residence
yo are you already on campus
ok we can possibly discuss it tomorrow but it is pretty straightforward what i need to do in the next few days
i will probably discuss with you after i come back from cusec yo in my statement of account there is a cost for residence fees and another cost for resident association and the rest is just tuition
goddamn son i guess i will go check with the financial office later
shit ya
ya later
great stuff i might need your help in a few things regarding designing the game
it is a straightforward puzzle design
where you are supposed to construct a structure out of pieces of magnets
the thing is i want to try to get the level designed before i demo it in the conference and i need to do some coding too before then if not then the week after next
or i could send just send you the game i finish coding it then you can try it out and think of something from there
what about it
alright man i gotta get back to coding
yo sorry i couldnt respond too busy right now i ended up spending more time on the talk than the coding and i felt too overwhelmed with the coding so i took a littlw break
it will be on friday i gotta practice for that
thanks buddy
siwtch press conference
oh that
go ahead man
yo my demo was presented today
people liked the idea thats about it
no i just showed them the build of my unity game i wish i could send it to you now but it is nearly 200mb
ya i can upload it there now if yo uwant
why is that and actually i jsut realized the build is only 16mb
it will take some time to upload though
but we wont be doing switch for our game though
at least we are not expecting me expecting
by the way gng4120s blackboard still isnt up i dont know what is up with that i cant even do their assignments and i cant give you the course syllabus either
httpswwwdropboxcomssozr17c65yiuol3build1exedl0 ya i got the iti httpsuottawablackboardcombbcswebdavpid1508655dtcontentrid203861781courses21718969outline20201121apdf not sure if you can access the blackboard page
oh really
you sent an attachment i will send you the build when we meet
aint a thang
ya it doesnt httpswwwamazoncaintroductioncomputerscienceusingjavadp0973342706 this is the book i used to learn java back in high school it doesnt teach anything more than programming techniques though yo i am gonna sign off kind of drunk from cider
sorry i am in class now sorry you mean cusec
it was nice i met a few people who liked my idea the judges liked my idea too but they honestly thought it was too science fictiony we are gonna prove them wrong though
i dont understand why they think it is unrealistic i mean it is very challenging but there is a solution to every problem
they think that this game is not going to have as much of an effect on education that we think it will thats probably it
well i have that feeling too but we will see how things work out if things dont work it it will naturally disintegrate
thanks buddy it is low quality but at the same time i am not showing this to an actual investor by the way that was the stuff that i wnated to show you before
ya i know right that itself could be a game
we just need to polish the graphics and add some music and sound create some gameplay then voila
i guess we will we should remind saif at 12pm right
where are we meeting
that could work
it is whatever c is but i am guessing it is object orientated because there are classes and objects
strict style
i aim to code with proper style so that the code is readable by other people but so far i have been doing a pretty bad job at commenting the functions
if you understand object orientated language then you should be able to understand these things without much trouble
like all of the variables and functions in the program have good names so that if you see the code it is intuitive how the program functions
later yo can you share with me again the google doc for the level you designed
yo man some of the guys didnt like the gameplay mechanic we came up with last time they dont mean the level design
but the core gameplay mechanic of controlling multiple characters
they wanted transformation not micromanagement
if all the club members can gather up next time then we can probably do a poll
i have some ideas for the transformation mechanic
we also came up with some architecture for the software like how we are going to code it but havent actually assigned any work
nah man oh wait one of us did keep the files but he needs to upload
nope the same old we gonna do some recruitment next week by the way i got a solid idea now what i need to program for our game
it probably isnt since you are 3rd year but good luck though
alright son i am gonna my ass back to work get my ass
later
lol this looks very nice just like gamification
yo there is a unity workshop happening today are you coming
6pm to 8pm
unfortunate
ya uodgc uottawa
lemme know if you cant find it
yo i wanted to ask you about something the game dev club needs someone to market the gamea do you know if you can do it or anybody who might be interested
great stuff we appreciate your help i will let the other execs know about your involvement and figure out what we should do next
yes we are changing the meeting to biweekly for now though execs are getting burnt out i am too
never did but i realized recently that maybe i should put off actually making this huge ass game i feel that i should learn a wide variety of gameplays first before taking on a huge project
that could be a nice idea but i am more interested in experimenting stuffs on my own that way i can learn quickly without wasting too much resources of time and effort because making studio does require energy
ya you should do game jams
ya pretty much well good luck on that if you need help with programming let me know
go ahead
alright
nope
do the roll the ball tutorial
it is the most efficient way to go about learning unity because all the other tutorials are too specific or redundant
i think those are great if you want to learn how to code a specific gameplay but dont waste your time on them if you dont have a concrete idea of what you want to do
yo you know the game dev club is happening today right
yes
lol i havent even started hopefully gonna start today
ya i know there arent
ya that is next wednesday i am gonna go definitely
not yet but i dont think it matters if there isnt enough seats available i will just stand somewhere
nope
yes
the club is mostly dead though at this point our club pres is not very motivated to advocate the club and neither am i
ya and quite honestly people who has prior experience in making games have way more motivation than those who dont which makes it hard to get new people into it anyways come if you can
ok
well good luck on that man i think i am gonna continue to play around with making random games i am actually follow some of that advice gabe newell gave about iterating design
or just simply put make more video games i dont know jackshit about video games until i make more of them
ya sure tell me one of them so i start thinking about it
ok so it is like an rts game without the rt time it will be tbs turn based strategy
so the goal is to just grow as a tribe
do you have any ideas for a first or third person game where you control a single character
i get a feeling that a lot of popular games nowadays are firstperson or lets you control a character in 3rd person
especialy with the arrival of vr i think we should focus on making games in that category
lol later man
not really well at least i am not considering it at the moment
eventually we can try that idea
not at the moment the only thing i have in mind now is just an image of the type of game i want to try making not an actual mechanic
i just saw a tutorial on unity where they got a bunch of white blocks in a completely white space i thought that looked pretty beautiful so i want to make a puzzle game out of that
yo i am gonna sign off for a bit but that is the one
great stuff looking forward to it
oh ya
ya thats what i thought too my original idea was to put the point b near the top of a chamber and you have to do stuffs with cubes to get to the top
man we should talk about this another time because right now i am trying to complete an assignment
i will probably be not that busy again this upcoming wednesday but fuck i actually got so much shit to do
ok
yo game dev club is happening tomorrow
it was yesterday
we didnt do much development we just coded stuff
yes
on april 1st
we got a workshop this wednesday though
wednesday night from 6pm to 8pm
github
it is up to you man
yes yo you just walked past me on fourth floor of fss did you just come out of the iti audit
i was sitting on a sofa
yo come up here there is an empty seat next to me you know what i will come down
yo club happening tomorrow 2095 vanier hall
1pm but you can come at 2 if you want
yo how are you doing man
i am doing good i got so much time between exams that i decided i get my hands on that box idea we discussed
alright thanks
hmm i wanted to know what kind of boxes you got planned
lol you know how to use unity already
what are you using to make that
you mean on unity
it is incredibly easy
the difference between them is that in one you have the camera inside the players body in the third person the camera is outside the players body
but you can modify the position of the camera relative to the player to change between 1st and 3rd and that is easily accomplished by modifying the position of the camera in the transform
alright awesome
later
yo no problem man take ur time hope ur exams are going well
pretty damn good
the exams are bitches though i just formed a romantic relationship with my classmate i am super happy
this was from that business course i recommended you
finish a prototype
yup lucky me she is also interested in game design so that kind of helped us get along
thanks man
sure as hell how are things going with you other than exams
man studying for the exams are not even that time consuming but all the procrastination is soaking up so much fucking tiem
ya get in some codes after 5pm after work lol it will be tough
but less procrastination
focus on that man be a master programmer in four months i can tell you it is entirely possible
yo back in grade 10 i made a few projects one is moving a knight piece on a chess board another one is hangman those two projects got myself a solid grasp on how most programming languages work
np man
there are probably tons of them on the internet
you can also try coderank sorry i meant hackerrank that is a repository of many computational challenges
it gamifies coding bascially
yo
getting good at coding should not take a long time like your main goal now should be learning as much stuff as possible after you get past a certain point your learning is going to plateau for coding
yeee and thanks
hey whats up
the pages are cut off
thanks man
fwang100uottawaca
i am not on my computer now but i will check them out later
i cant read them man sorry you gotta make the images clearer
just type them out dude
ya
ok this stuff all sounds interesting at the moment so that is good i would love to help but nowadays i might not be able to contribute rapidly i took on a parttime remote job in a startup
coding stuffs on unity they are not paying me yet they gotta look for funding but they deal with vr and i am interested in vr i am gonna have lunch now later
yo how is your game dev going
oh hell ya man good to hear that you are back in business busy with work
oh shieet son 60h they are goddamn demons for making you work that hard
i am getting better and better at 3d modelling and i am hoping i can make a rendered interior design by the end of the summer to put on my resume
ya i am using blender
this is my most recent render you sent a photo hey buddy what is going on with you these days i am wondering if you are interested in hearing more about it and giving me some potential ideas
awesome dude try not to kill yourself working too hard that nearly happened to me once at the moment the game consists of purely gameplay mechanic and the simplest chamber which will prevent you from completing the level
i will show you the actual prototype when we meet again at uottawa
i am back on saturday ya because it is an original ifea i was originally planning to make a game about a poltergeist trolling the resident of an apartment unit do you see where i am going with this
yup
right on
what is this thing
alright well this is nice
hey you should totally just take over the project i have so many commitments nowadays i have no time to work on this
i am helping some guy developing his game and i am learning about the more artistic side of unity like lighting and texturing thatâs alright man
looking forward to it
i am doing that game mostly as a vehicle for learning lol i donât care much for that game
seg2105
i am taking it now what do you want to know about it
what is its prerequist
iti1121 ok wouldnât recommend seg2105
can you take the c course in the second year csi
take that instead and do the iti1121
yes seg2105 is not a very practical course lots of theory that you might never use
never used revit so no idea
ohhh i see for blender and 3dsmax you can just put the file in the asset folder and it does the importing for you automatically not sure about revitt
no problem man
ya the course is ok i am doing fine but like i said i get easily distracted in the course because the content is so theoretical i could have learnt those while i am doing my job
sure thing yo dude check the text messages i sent you i dont see nothing man
yo i wanted to give you an overview of what needs to be done at the moment i am aiming to create three levels or however many levels that are good for demoing the game
i am watching these videos so the thing with the collision is meant to happen to prevent the mirror from going through the wall but i forgot that will also stop players from being able to move through doors
i will look into it i rarely tested that door in the middle of the house so i will have to pay more attention to it
forget about the front door that door wont be a major player in the game for now pretend that it is just a wall
so the levels the first level is meant to be easy on the player and introduces the basic game mechanic and after that the player needs to throw out the last remaining box to the front entrance
the context of the first level is that the player just finished up unpacking everything and the figurine doll was mysteriously left on the table
because a figurine is a type of decoration and it is meant to be placed on his gamework desk
so it is good that you noticed tha the context does matter a lot these puzzles wont make any sense or feel unimportant when there is no context
sorry what
right so if you got a better idea i am all ears the only reason why i chose to do something with the figurine is that it attracts the players attention
but that instructional thing is something to be added later for now just focus on purely the context and puzzle
i am not entirely sure now that i think about it because i dont know how i am going to use the cardboard box alongside the figurine oh wait maybe it will work ya i think this is fine
ya we can certainly add that
haha ya
this morning i was thinking about watching some films that lack dialogue to study how people in the past have used just purely visual cues to convey story and information i think that will help a lot for this game since we are going to tell a story without any sort of voice acting or texts
and of course horror films if we are aiming for that type of experience lol
well i am not actually that hung up about horror or creepiness it is actually more meant as a light hearted game
because i want the poltergeist to eventually be portrayed as an annoying pet rather than a ghostly being good that you remembered
ya there are way too many horror games out there
ya do you know how to setup the level in unity like do you know how to objects work
in terms of the basic tools i implemented if you want an object to be possessed then you need to attach levelitem script to it and add a rigidbody and rigidbody of course each possessed item needs a triggerbox
thats awesome no worries i think it would be nice if we can finish at least a demo of this by this summer so we are kind of on a timeline
ya man it is arguably one of the best countries in the world overall
i might get somebody else involved to help fix some bugs
lol when did that happen
damn that is an old timers show but definitely still good
the classics those are good times yo i am gonna sign off for now i still gotta work
later yo have you had time to look over the level
alright no problem was just curious i am gonna keep maintaining the mechanics to be more usable and realistic
no worries man yo hows it going man
good stuff man i was working a lot on some important bugs of the game over the weekend and got caught up in them without actually progressing much i will chat with you in a bit
so in the meantime give me a list of things that you would like to see implemented that will also allow you to actually make the full level not just the main puzzle
i donât get the second mechanic if it is in the view of another object what is this âanother objectâ
like if you see something then it disappears or if the doll sees something then that also disappears
i can implement both type of things for you to test out
we should still focus on the first level though keep those ideas we will come back to them
you cant relaly work that well on level 1 until i get the mission system working but i guess you can just think about some ideas
there might be plenty of bugs i honestly thought i got all of those bugs figured out
yo just to let you know you might want to not work on the game temporarily because there are still a lot of bugs that i need to fix and features to be implemented will take some time
well thatâs good hopefully you will get to use those ideas soon
lets see obviously a lot of work went into making this game the core mechanic of shooting stuffs is not hard at all in fact one of the unity tutorials teach you how to make one
yo this weekend i am going to implement this huge mission system that is going to help a lot with the development of this game
yo in case you are wondering when we are gonna do anything about the game i am going to be busy learning machine learning stuffs until feb 25th
you are doing machine learning
dang son well i guess have fun i swear i am not gonna put more stuffs on my plate after this month is over
i implemented it over saturday havenât had the chance to debug yet
ya it really is i wanna make some deepfake videos with what i learn  if you catch my drift ð
for the mission system i specifically implemented a system where you can create as many objectives for each level purely using unity interface no coding requires required the only type of objective available now is moving objects arounds
i basically added a bunch of features that made it easier for noncoders to design levels but coders like myself will be also using the interface as well because it is just so much easier
great stuff man
i am at a hackathon right now will chat with you in a bit
after this hackathon i am gonna go back to the game dev but this break from the game helped me figure out how to code a more effective mirror and detect items reflected from multiple mirrors
it is about using microsoftâs machine learning tools to recognize human face and determine when they are tired
microsoft face api
what i dont know about the supervision but i imagine it was supervised
oh no no i was thinking about the solution to the problem while riding on the bus it has nothing to do with machine learning sometimes you gotta take break from your work to think about it clearly
and this is a perfect example of that case
ya me too i used to like taking walks but i dont like to do that in a urbanized neighborhood
ya thats right the next update is going to take a while lol
the major features are not properly working now so i got to fix them
that is actually a great idea there are definitely lots of things to think about for the story
i was also thinking we can try to incorporate a metaphor of some kind related to mirror since there will be so many mirrors in the game
one idea i had was use the mirrors to comment on how people are incredibly selfconscious and that leads to low selfesteem but that doesnt have a direct relationship with the poltergeist
yes man things are coming together
haha that would be funny that can lead to so much dry humor
i dont think deathnote was trying to be it was only funny when people started memeing the potato chips
but ya we can also throw in some of those over the top moments
i am overly attached to the modern setting for now but i am all ears if you can make those odd settings interesting
dont think so what kind of boat is this
it could work but the interior would be differently designed and yes it will be constricting
i think anything could work it is a matter of designing the interior in a way that is conducive to the gameplay and i think there is nothing wrong with the aircraft carrier
ya thats what i am doing now but i am gonna go to sleep for now gotta work tomorrow
ok
you too
oh ya for sure i will be how are you doing these days getting a mirror to work properly is a pain in the ass
lol ok good luck on thise those
in terms of the implementation of the game i am trying to get the mirror to work perfectly and it requires me to get involves with math intensive graphic features of unity that i never touched before so it will take some time
ya dude you will need it but i do understand why you are not working on it now when you are swamped with group projects having one of them is bad enough but four shiiieeeet
any sort of practice is good for you i believe have you done the tutorials on the unity website
dude you are not gonna believe this shit
i managed to break through the mirror problem
dude it was because i forgot to add a small piece of code from the tutorial that i was following
and i spent like at least two weekends banging my head against the wall trying to figure this shit out
ya it absolutely is but now i can move on to program the core mechanic which i already have a good idea of and maybe next week i can give you the game for you to play around with
i am looking forward to your ideas
haha ya this is definitely 100 times more fun than anything the school can offer
ya absolutely let me know when you are free would love to hear about your ideas
alright
later not to burst the bubble or anything but the mirror is still a long way to go unfortunately after solving the old problem i realized that the mirror is not properly reflecting the image of other mirrors
you think ok then in that case i can still focus on the other things i mentioned to you before
haha that is true
ya sure i am available all day next weekend during weekdays i am available after 6pm but preferably i dont do weekdays
ya i might be able to teach you how to use the tools i made to design a level we should meet this saturday we also got an unity workshop happening between 36pm on that day
ok
nah i ainât at the moment i am probably going to have to attend the workshop anyways as a mentor if you are not available during that time then when are you available
ok we can meet up somewhere then maybe grab dinner while we are at it
let me know if you have an idea where to have dinner ideally a place with wifi and bring your laptop too maybe we can try school cafeteria or we can talk business first then go have dinner
alright so you still down for today at 6pm
where
gg well my condolences to you
well we can talk about that after we meet i donât know any place with wifi and drinks especially a place where we can talk business if you got any ideas i am all ears though
where is this place oh its the place right next to uottawa ya sure we can go if you want
alright then i will meet you there at 6pm today
ya son the unity tutorial is a complete bust if you wanna meet up at any time from now let me know
i will get on it after work thanks for making this
by the way which folder am i supposed to be using
ok
great stuff
nope
absolutely
i would use a combination of both but i cant help you now cuz i am at work
alright man looking forward to it
darling in the franxx
currently airing but it is super good so you might have a hard time focusing
awesome man i am busy these days but i will definitely have time to look over anything new you might add
awesome i will look over them sometime today
i dont know his plan i actually think he will be sticking around cuz he mentioned a few times saying that we should meet up during summer to work on the game
who knows this kind of stuff is hard to say but he did say he will work and he said he got a good handle on unity and blender over the course of past few weeks
why is mostapha important for this
i totally forgot that we do still need to test user reaction in the early stage mostapha will probably have a hard time contributing because he is not familiar with the code base
i will discuss with you after i finish my coop report
alright man
great that you are taking the initiative hopefully i will get back to you soon i am dying to get back working on this game again too later man
yo i am back online now go on slack and chat
hey can you check the slack channel
i will be there between september till 2019 april when is your graduation
great i will be there too at that time
for sure
3 weeks can cost you around 3000  4000 canadian
dude i need to ask you a quesion about business did you have to take a first year course on management
did you ever have to do an assignment where you talk about a realworld issue and they relate to the four functions of management how it relates
my group decided to talk about something related to accessing social media data for business purposes but i can only think about its relevance to planning and controlling functions
we havent discussed specifics but it could be marketing and recruitment in fact we might have to cover all of that but lets take the leading aspect of management how can that have anything to do with social media
i mean maybe the company has its own social media and people discussing their thoughts on the social media can help identify leadership features that are most optimized for their employees
right
but wouldnât identifying valuable gamers be something in the planning category oh wait nvm i am wrong
i dont really understand the bottom right portion
bottom right like what does that entryopen represent
oh ok you want the door to the apartment unit in the center of the right wall instead of at the bottom right corner
ok what is that black bar between entertainment and bedroom
you want to enter the bedroom from the kitchen quadrant
bedroom  bathroom  storage is that the path that i am seeing
is the only way to enter storage from the bathroom
and is the only way to enter bathroom from bedroom
i thought you felt the connection between bathroom and bedroom to be awkward
the current day1 scene you mean
right i can make these changes to the layout and hopefully that can fix your problem
are the right two quadrants around the right size that you want or do you want that to be bigger too
you want the entire scene right now to be 2030 bigger
ok
ok whenever you have time we can work together to modify this in blender or actually i do think you knowing how to modify these things will expedite this entire process especially in blender
we can have a session and i can at least teach you what you need to do for this one particular scene that will simplify stuffs
you dont need to learn everything about blender but you should know at least enough to modify the scene as you fit yes for sure
ya you can jot down notes i can do tomorrow night or weekend nights
ya that works i will see you tomorrow then
good night
dont worry no pressure but i do want that document asap
which half is that ok
do you still need to polish them or something
ok
alright i will have at least these things to work on
how does the player get awoken by the alarm clock when the doll is in its place is the alarm clock like hidden
the noise of what
ya but where is the alarm clock is it right next to him where he left it or did the poltergeist move the alarm
right thats what i wanted to know i think this scenario is simple enough it is a good starting point
this will help me better imagine what kind of apartment unit we want or at least the feel
i just got a new idea
is this guy working from home or at office
hmm ok i guess he can do both he will go out of his apartment when he needs to meet people
ya i was questioning whether the game requires the player to leave the apartment but seems like we still do
ya that is about as far as it will go the environment ends at the apartment building entrance
and yo reading your scenario made my past ideas so much more concrete
ya this is actually terrific
it makes the level design make sense
oh ya are we still doing the session where i show you how to design the apartment layout that was supposed to be tonight
we will see how long we can still do it as long as i am awake
ok
hey are you free this weekend to have the tutorial session
good
ok um how should we do this
maybe you can share your screen and we will see where we can go from there skype works my skype username is ftwdullsword dude how are you doing with life
in the hood lol i am good man i just wanted to check out what you are doing i got some time now i am learning tech these days man
i am doing deep learning right now i am practicing that stuff as we speak i remember you were also doing machine learning right
tell me about it man
i learned all the basics of neural networks like convolution and recurrent neural networks unsupervised learning methods and how to optimize their efficiency i want to run some image analysis on some ct scans obtained from kaggle
yes sir
oh that will be in toronto
if you ever need some help you can always ask me i know some basics i also have like tutorial codes available to me so i just learn off of those
i think you told me about it before it was the one with reducing time spent on email or something
not really lol i am done with game dev for now i dont know when i will ever get back to it
so did you find a job already after you graduate
oh nice
well just brace for that moment when all those jobs give you an offer
you wont be laughing when it actually happens
a true man never let other people motivate himself though just focus on doing the best you can for the company is all mentalities can change very rapidly
i know right game development had the same effect on me too i never would have gotten involved in ai if i didnât know unity i think being in school just forces you to explore these different options
you should learn javascript i also want to do web development so i can create my own website and that is often the starting point of a new business
i dont know if you are going to do a website for your applicatino though
that sounds incredible man i remember when i first met you you couldnt properly code a simple python program from first year computer science class you have come a long way
my summer job may require me to create an online database to share medical image data between clinicians
nope but i wanna learn it soon web and app development will make you the best businesses these days
that is actually the only way for you to compete with a lot of the dominating but traditional businesses out there
i am assuming there arent anybody if my supervisor claims it he must have done his research
this could actually be a big break for me because he suggested that this could be a new business
ya we also want to add a statistical model to help identify medical properties of those images that is also the other reason they hired me so i can offer both engineering and ai expertise on the project
haha thanks man
like what deep learning
ya that is true but that is only if you are hooking up hospital networks with the database
like the ai that understands texts
no because i think that is too long term of a dedication initially i couldnt find the time to do much of it
and there are people in the field who are far more knowledgeable about this than i am so it seems overwhelming for me to tackle that challenge
never did but i dont know any intermediate of an idea like that there is like a threshold that you must cross to get users anything less than that seems pretty pointless
yes like i dont know if you ever played competitive video games but it took me years to get good at starcraft
lol i was pretty high ranking but it took years to get to that stage and you had to spend every waking moment thinking of it
i dont think they are making an ai for sc but my pooint being that it will take the same amount of effort to get good at text understanding as it is to get good at sc
oh really guess they are jumping on that whole bandwagon but sc is not even that big of a deal anymore
nice man you can do a lot during those 3 months take a small break and then get back to the grinding right away
it is a good plan everybody should be doing that honestly i pretty much bootcamp everyday lol
i am enjoying a few things here and there i know some fellow canadian students who went and travelled in many places but i canât enjoy myself as much as those others
ya i just canât enjoy sightseeing as much as most poeple i still wanna go to hokkaido region and okinawa island
they are the most extreme regions of japan haha ya there are plenty of fun things to do in life than travelling
what is ocr for those things you can either use traditional machine learning or deep learning technologies the latter one is what everybody is studying nowadays and can be used in a great number of areas
great stuff
aleight man good luck
nice dude donât be like me stay out of school
yes take lessons udemy bootcamp
nice
why isnât he accepting
lol well too bad man ð
was brightspace not working or something
you can always go to the faculty to complain
but usually if you have like a one day late submission you get like 30 deducted instead of being outright rejected
lol such kind of professor is a real rarity these days
just do what you can man it ainât a big deal if this doesnât work out
freed from their shackle you can now fulfill your destiny
i will talk to you later going back to work
haha good luck
i donât know phaser dude
ya focus on one thing yo howâs it going man how did it go with the final paper
lol thats some good shit did you already leave ottawa permanently
i see thats too bad would have loved to meetup after i come back from canada
no i am working in toronto for 4 months during summer then going back to ottawa for school year
yes
are you coming back to toronto or something sorry not back coming to
oh ok
i knew this a while ago
ya i look bad here you look ok though
lol really with a dark armpitï¼
lol thanks for your compliment but you and i know thatâs bullshit
i am learning web dev with node js
oh ya where you learning it
with andrew mead
that one is good
i see
what gigs you got
oh ok that could be a good exercise for you
i will be using it for summer but i also just want to be able to do web dev for my personal stuffs
well it is popular for a reason they also got a tensorflowjs so you can seamlessly integrate node with deep learning yo do you got any business ideas for web dev
i want one that i want to use to practice web dev
whatâs for the backend
i thought firebase is a database not a backend framework and firebase makes use of sql right
i wanted to hear some of your business ideas one that can make somebody rich
so how does that work
so how do you verify that goal is accomplished
i mean it could definitely be a cool personal project but it just doesnât seem that reliable until you find a way to properly verify achievements
how so
that is an idea that is certainly worth thinking about i will talk to you another time when i am not working
dude have you ever heard about this business model called platform scale
you should read about it it is a modern business model used by a variety of succesful companies like uber airbnb and youtube if you want to make money fast this is what you should be doing
the general gist of the model is to take advantage of the interconnectedness of people to avoid many of the overhead cost of traditional businesses it also grows extremely rapidly because it is far more organic yes
ya
i think regarding your example of the habit app one way to verify achievements could actually be to tap the users of the app like have the users verify amongst themselves
yes
yup actually wait is there even any app that does that
anyways this is something to think about
dude i came up with a great idea this way we shift people away from a rewardcentric view of life to a more lifelong learning environment
the definition of a life coach or mentor is very wide i think anybody can be a coach given  the right mindset like it is one of those things people can become until somebody tell them that they can be but even without that there are already plenty of people who can become a mentor purely based on their qualifications like teachers retired professors businessman or counsellors of any type who donât want to work in an organizational setting
they would have to be altruistic which i think this world has plenty of supply of in fact reward of money might actually prevent people from wanting to use this app
we could charge a small subscription fee for the mentees like it would make money the same way medium makes money obviously more research needs to be done but similar businesses exist
i think we should do more research before we go all in the points you made were very valid
hmmm have you thought about taking it to the tech shop at ucu the problem i mean
it is right at the entrance of ucu if you enter from louis pasteur
no problem let me know how it goes yo whats up you doing anything for thanksgiving
oh same my roommates invited me to dinner in the cafeteria
did your roommates invite you as well
you seem to know a lot of people
spending most of your time studying doesnt lead to people inviting you to dinner but anyways you didnt happen to have done much studying for linear algebra did you
i am beginning to feel a little worried about it since i havent worked on it this weekend next week will be crunch time
oh is that right by the way thank god i started going to your classes instead of my official one barry is an absolute beast at teaching
you can stop crunching after you stop taking all the basic science courses those classes are absolute time wasters in the sense that they take away a lot of time and it adds lots of anxiety
i might be of service to youi have done chemistry in the past sounds hell of a lot more interesting than the task in front of me at the moment
heidi missed your call
lol i was surprised some urgent chemistry problem so what chemistry problem are you working on
for the first blank you need to calculate the change in volume then use that change of volume to calculate work done to the system the work is the q wpdelta v
there is a formula for e    w  q the internal energy of a system should be related to the temperature of the system so deltae can be calculated from temperature change
whats the unit joulesgxdeltat i think you see where i am directing you right
you should calculate the 2nd one first simply from w  pv then you calculate the 3rd one then you subtract 2nd from 3rd to get the 1st
can you try opposite sign the unit for pressure in the question is barr but maybe you need to convert it to pascal or atm
what did you do for your first attempt
your delta v should be 272 l or something equivalent to that
work should be positive
do you have a textbook that shows how to use this equation you should convert the units in the question to the same ones used in textbook the thing is atm is not a standard unit its typically pa
lemme know if you need more help its unfortunate that i couldnt help you with the other question
i see
standard change of entropy the change in entropy of a substance under standard condition
no how much entropy change occurs entropy is not the same as energy if you want heat release you should use the h
you sound like you dont get jt is there something bothering you
you sent a sticker ok well good luck on it i actually gotta study for my own stuff now lol this friggin art
no no no i was just bored doing my own stuff so it was a good break i am sure it is frustrating just keep chugging at it you will get it done before you know it
you will if you do another undergrad degree after your current one anyways good luck on it and have fun at your dinner i know i will be
oh hell ya lets do it when do you want to do it
i thought i am coming over to friel
no i have not i thought you guys are in the same res you havent spoken to him
alright well i will ask him but i am gonna come over to friel regardless of whether he replies back just in case he tells us he wants to join in the last minute
so when do you want to meet
alright then tell me the place and time
sounds good
i live on the campus girl
well it aint believe it
it is up to you i am gonna go there cuz i know qas is going
ok the after you finish eating lets meet up at minto at around 350
isnt that the name of the gym
that is the one on the other side of site building right
yo wait for me in front of the site building main entrance
yo i went back to my house just now to get changed i will meet you at the cafeteria tell me when you get there
alright i am coming now
lol this seems like some crazy stuff are you going
how much is the ticket
haha i will think about it who else are coming
i got no costume you got any advice on that
when does it start
can you come up with an idea for a costume
haha yes i suppose you know what i cannot do kiri i dont have his costumes i will go check out if i can get something from the dollar store
yo do you think a mask will suffice
alright what is your schedule like for tonight
when are you going and where are you meeting with people
which pub the one at the event hey which of the events are you going to there is a bourbon room and tequila jacks

shieeeet
oh at least i guessed true for it how was the test for you
what did you get for your p and q
there was a question where you had the find p and q in a matrix which p and q gives the unique solution infinite solution and inconsistent
lol everybody got different numbers for it seems like
ya old habbit dies hard yo i wont be joining you today at math class  but let me know if you are going to the gym
lol have fun with that maybe next week
you do realize i am sitting behind you right
hey do you know if qass has a cell phone number
just out of curiosity he told me he doesnt but today i was reminded of how weird it is for a university student to not have a phone number when he has a phone
right
when
ok
i am gonna start with treadmill
any columns with a leading one is a vector that can form part of a basis rank  leading ones rank 4  4 leading ones r4
dont sweat it
yo whats up
off document oh you mean the pdfs
ya i do i can send them to you which ones do you need
ya
httpsuottawablackboardcombbcswebdavpid1254160dtcontentrid200003871courses20169ps48099mat1341bfall15t3pdf can you access this page

let me help you with the biology stuff i can give you some tips on studying biology
when you think you studied enough let me know i can help you test some stuffs
set a goal for yourself then
no i mean studying goal how much do you aim to study surely you wont study only 60 percent of the material
anyways set a studying goal and once you reached that goal call me
nice
well the maximum number of leading ones you can get for this matrix is 11 but that last row will always make it such that it is a linear combination of the rest of the rows
if you are talking about row space in a nxm matrix nm or nm
you can try it out yourseld
yes i will you should too if you need help with biology i am still available
i am sure you can do it just dont make your life miserable doing it
if you want to do more than pass the course let me know
hey are you going to study at ucu tomorrow
hmm ok come to ucu if you need some help i am gonna go eat there as well tomorrow
oh ok when you said you will study at merriet i thought you meant you could get your meal somewhere else then sure i can meet you at ucu after you finish your breakfast send me a message
yo hope you had a nice christmas and also thanks for hanging out with a boring guy like me during this semester xd i hope we can hang out more in the future going to gym studying or anything have a wonderful break
ya for sure
yo i am sorry to hear that who is this person
was it one of those sudden outbursts
well people are just sometimes like that they say nasty things for no reason but it is best you treat this as an accident rather than something personally against you
whoa
how long did this go on for
dont worry too much about it
i dont think you should take it personally she likely does it to other people probably not just you
dont let it hang over you
when was the last time
i am sorry to hear about your situation but i still dont think you should take it seriously even if this was the second time
unless she is gonna kick you out of the house
right i think you can try approaching this calmly understand that her outbursts are not because of significant issues with you and try to reason with her but this works for me
well you should only tell her that when she is calm xd but i will be here if you need company for the next few days
i am bored out of my mind working on programming so it would be nice if i get to talk with some people
not much to do honestly i only have few friends i care about
haha thats true i meant i only have a few friends who i hang out with often how has your break been other this little hiccup
nice where did you go
haha i see pmall huh i went there too with my friends but we didnt really do much
i noticed you always had your fingernails done in class they did look nice
we didnt do jack there we didnt know what we were doing we just needed a place to walk and chat
we ended up playing horror games after that
the very good ones are scary as hell which is good but anytthing less than the best are not scary its a tough market
do you watch horror movies
i gotta check that out sometimes i feel like i have gone through all the good ones and i cant find any ones that are fresh and good
i dont know do you think you are
whats your other personality
lol ya i was about to say its hard to tell
lol
i think you have behaved well in university i havent seen any crazy parts about you yet
how did that go by the way
did you get any marks back i havent gotten back mine and it is driving me nuts
did you watch any of the conjuring series horror movie
man you should see the first one i havent seen the second one though how was it
haha same when me and my friends were playing the game called outlast we cut off all the light sources we got jump scared a few times but i love it the thrill
i have trouble sleeping after watching really good ones i couldnt sleep after conjuring 1 ring and the exorcist
ya totally but i also feel that life experience does increase tolerance
i remember i was so scared when i was a kid after watching some films that are not even acary when i look bsck
dealing with crazy ladies in our lives probably also helps xd
sorry about that bad joke
i had dealt with my own share of crazy ladies in my life
one was my mothers former temperament the other one was my former boss in master
ya they are were
i dont have anger issues period
my coworkers in the past witnessed my boss yelling at me but they were astounded at how i stood there like a rock i do get angry but i keep it all in me
haha yup just like your guardian i am always conflicted about reporting stuff
if you cant tolerate it you should people are not meant to endure that kind of environment
but i know how to deal with those kinds of people now and i dont get mad at them for yelling at me but of course it is always better to not deal with those types of people
yaanxiety its a terrible thing i feel you i hope you dont feel too stressed about it its really not your fault
can i ask what lead her to say that if you dont mind
lolthat was interesting i think you might want to apologize to her if you get the opportunity because you did swear in front of her thats not gonna change
but her reaction was still overexaggerated
did you apologize sincerely
well you know what you should do one of you guys have to be an adult here
your guardian has the temperament of a kid
and you need to show that you are an adult by being the one to initiate an apology how you do it is up to you
how do you know that
jesus technically you didnt have to go visit her right
you got your residence and all i see
i guess you are gonna have to tough it out or you need to prove to your parents that you are independent
i know what you are saying i met people like that
it is a tough situation but life is sometimes like that
you should get indepdent soon
and this does mean you need to be careful about the stuffs you do so you dont end up in a deep shit and nobody is there to take care of you
i am sorry for sounding like a counsellor it is my bad habit
i think if you play your cards right you can make the first option a reality but also dont do anything stupid to make the second option a reality
gotta work hard then
but yo related to the conversation you had with your guardian i dont know about your life style but whatever it is if you think you can reach your life goal with your life style there shouldnt be any problem following it but if your life style isnt working out then maybe it is time to change it
thats all i am gonna say about your problem this conversation is too serious xd
i am sure you will
lol ya meaningful
it was my pleasure
you tooð´ happy new year hope everythings going alright with you
is everything alright with your guardian
good to hear thatð
i only get to live one 2017 ð yo whats up you back in town yet
i have been working on some stuffs going to a student conference next week working on presentation and demo materials but damn 5 hour delay
aint that something anything new with you in the past few days
what did you do for chilling
oh nice do they miss you sorry was that a rude question
haha i was over thinking i am playing a game with my friend now
sorry for ditching the convo last night but at least we won ð ready for school tomorrow
i cant read it oh wait it is better now
whats chg chemical engineering that sounds tough by the way that schedule looks more intense than my first year at u of t
lol lets do it
only on sunday whats up or saturday night
haha ya that would be nice
wanna go out for dinner or something or go out for movie
lol sure i respect that
ya no prob
spend big money recently and are there anything you specifically want to eat
do you know how to make them
you dont have to i got rice cooker in my res
do you know how to make stir fries
damn that sounds good
ya i got em all
mapo tofu
do you want me to cook that instead of the stir fry then
it is a little inconvenient to make both cuz i only got one wok you need to choose
i can make the tofu make me some stir fries next time
alright you know what if it makes things easier for you you can cook the stir fry at my place
you said you also want to see a movie on sunday this is what i am thinking
i am looking forward to it
sweet dreams yo is there a particular movie you are interested in watching
wanna try autopsy of jane doe sorry for calling you out late last night hops that didnt wake you up
it is horror by the way
i am really looking forward to it
i wouldnt have chosen it if it didnt get food review good how was your party
just to be safe
lol i see sounds like you
goddamn sounds like it was serious
what is your plan for today i am busy at a conference until tonight
possibly craigslist
if you are doing customer service then yes it could be difficult
i feel you
you can try sending a bunch of resume never hurts
ya like i said craiglist
dont worry i will always be here if you need help thats about the only thing i am good at
it is hard to explain i meant when it comes to dealing with people i am only good at helping them
try to avoid getting to that stage if you can you can too easily shut off your emotion once you get there and you will end up like með
haha alright yo i am gonna go take a shower now and then go for breakfast
you too yo for tomorrow lets meet up at metro i gotta buy a few things there you need to buy some stuffs too right
great
yes
ya i think that is fine you can wait for me at the faculty of law building do you know where that is
79 jean jacque lussier sorry it is 79 louis pasteur pvt
yo how are things going with you
definitely much busier than last semester
for the past week or so i havent had time to do much other than study i think your work load will stay consistent over the years
mine will get busier and busier haha i know right
oh comon math wasnt that bad
how much are the assignments worth cuz that seems incredibly inefficient
each assignment is worth 10
right but 12 hours per week is still kind of ridiculous that is like nearly half of your weekend
lol you shouldnt do taht to me heidi i will take you too seriously
no worries
ya i appreciate your care i think i am gonna do fine this semester but it will definitely be more work and kind of slowly came to the realization that i should study things during my off time
how is your job search going maybe go live in toronto
that sucks it is hard for you to stay in ottawa without finding a job i mean and it is hard to find a job like you mentioned to me last time but you can always try
ya thats what i think too
you and your prostitutions
you keep bringing that up
ya i know
yo i know you do trust me but i do wish you get a job though and settle down i kind of know how you feel right now so much pressure it is not a nice feeling
ya definitely but unfortunately the pool of jobs that i look into are incompatible with your career type
that aint a problem
hard worker good night hardworker
yo happy valentines day hows everything going
nice past few days has been a bit stressful for me but i finished the all important tasks today so i am relaxing a bit
but yo i got to ask you for a favor you still doing chemistry
alright the favor that i need to ask you is that i need to take a bit of your time to interview how the course is
i am taking an etrepreneurial course this semester and i need to interview people to validate a product that i am making yo this will be face to face which is why it is a favorð
possibly thursday in the morning or when are you available
great
right i might have a few people with me to demo how to interview people
about 1015 min
i will give you more details when it is finalized dont set up a time yet it is not finalized but i appreciate you offering your time
haha thank you
but you good luck with your chemistry i know it is a tough course i had tons of trouble with it back in my days
no dont think so the plan changed but i appreciate your offer to help
i might need help somebody but yes please get a good night sleep
haha yes
good luck on dat
yo are you doing anything for reading week
i am just bored to hell right now
ya probably cuz i dont have much to do
oh shit thats awesome what job is it
well at least you are getting paid for something and if you like out doors then thats great too
it is great that you found a foot hold oh
all day as in 8 hour a day or more
thats not too bad what are you disatisfied about
but what summer courses do you have to do its not like you failed a course or anything
are you fucking serious that is a really shit program i never heard about anything like that
even though you didnt fail anything i dont think you will take 7 maybe 6 is max but 7 is something else
6 is doable but it depends on what kind of courses you have and it also means you have to fine tune your studying strategy to be more efficient
it is easier finding a solution to the problem than switching
or at least switching can set you back quite a bit
but i wonder what other good programs are out there
well i believe i have some time
i would love to help if you need any but unfortunately i can only offer you study advice
well you dont sound so confident when you were talking about 6 course term
but do you procrastinate that much
but you seem to be always studying something but you are studying for the training are you not so it is forgivable that you are not studying chem or doing chem lab
lol what were you doing sorry this is my last question before i leave you in peace
i see you might be stressed out anyways if you got a plan on wednesday let me know
ya it is kind of far i dont know any other good ones
what kind of snacks
oh right i need to buy some friggin shrimps without the tail shell
ya lets go i will buy some of my own stuffs
you wanna go in the morning
lets meet up at 10am which bus do we have to take we can meet at the bus stop
lets meet at mackenzie king station
10am

fwang100uottawaca thanks

so like what is gonna happen
when are you guys drinking 8pm
alright i will come over for a little at around 8pm then i can meet ur friends and meetup with you
ya i wont i got nothing
i will think about it
thanks for the invitation you know what i probably will not go to the club but i will catchup with you for a short while before you guys go clubbing
just make sure there is enough time between i come and when you guys leave for clubbing
i will meet you at friel right
ok just tell me when is the best time to come i can come earlier than 8
ok i am gonna come over now i dont need to bring anything right
i am here now
first floor actually i am outside i cant enter
yo havent heart from you in a while heard i am doing very well right now doing interviews for coop i havent made any plans as of yet but i think i will be spending time with my girlfriend
where do you live now
i see i will see if my girlfriend is interested
ya ok what kind of party is this
so this is on thanksgiving right
alright
no clue i might scan tomorrow
hopefully the office has a scanner
ya it is pretty bad but they donât really care though because they are not a business
ok
you need to go to ciena guest
yes
then what happens when you click on carling
is your wifi working
maybe try exiting and see if that restores anything
what happens when you click on cancel
so you cant access the company wifi after connecting
i have no idea what is wrong maybe wait for a while
great stuff how are you spending your weekend
hmmm writing report sounds like a good plan
rie is that some japanese girl wait momoko lol japanese girls are your friends
who is oli
is this from the japanese club
shiieeeeet
is he one of the club execs
executive position
lol savage as fuck son do you write reports during work or do you do it strictly outside of work
that is unfortunate so much free time during work you can potentially use them to write your report
haha i see i have lots of down time for my current task but i might also get busy next week so i might be just like you
not very productive but it is expected
but it is also nonproductive because my work now involves messaging people from other teams and they are all busy now so i had lots of down time like the work is not challenging anymore
but the features themselves are not that complicated right it is just a simple matter of learning new tools
well you are not gonna need to use them after you leave this place in one and half month
but it sounds like you are still optimistic about your learning which is good or maybe i am just getting depressed from the slowness of my current task
ya that is a major problem with this coop we are too far removed from the final product for us to feel any sort of impact of what we are doing
guess so and att facebook too supposedly but maybe we are too inexperienced to appreciate the work that we are doing
you can ask your boss why engage in technical conversations
i lost the election lol too bad for that i guess but it is honestly to be expected since i am not really that popular in the faculty
everybody who won i know are incredibly well known students
ya i know all of them and their popularity is certainly much stronger than mine you donât talk to enough people lol
two the students who won are also doing coop now the two chinese one of them has like 800 friends on facebook so he is obviously very popular
haha ya thats what i thought too honestly thats just how it is you only voted for me because i was the only one you knew lol
oh hell ya thats gotta suck you better hope that guy is smart
i havenât started yet no concrete plan and i have no table of content better start with writing the result than the table of content
i am going to focus on what i have done and what i learned from the experience learned stuffs are like team management and problem solving skills and product development workflow
do it
yo can i see your report the from now or the one from last summer
fwang100uottawaca
ok thanks buddy
thanks a lot gonna check it out now
yo i just skimmed over it how many words is this it is pretty damn short this must be like less than 2500 words
was the requirement 2500 for you or 2000
ok yo you should watch darling in the franxx that anime is good
of course
people piloting robots to kill monsters but it is more than that it is also about the characters who pilot them
you need to watch it now
lol then why are you talking with me yo i finished writing the report not formatted yet for your reference you sent an attachment
you are welcome son yo i wanna see your ass tuesday next week i already left the building by the way
alright
ok yo letâs meet at 1130 on tuesday how long are we gonna train for
are you going to eat out or go back home right after
i meant to ask are you usually very tired after training cuz i gotta bike back home later i was considering eating at cafeteria
oohhh right ya then i am gonna have to go back home or eat out i am meeting another individual that day
forget that i asked we will just train thatâs it
aright
i will do whatever plan you got on the first day

yo are you going to gym after 3131 tomorrow i will come with my real shoes this time
aleight son yo have you ever been to csi3131 tutorial

ok just making sure i am fine man but i am feeling it
anyways good night see you next week probably come with you again on tuesday
my partner is doing the lab he is also submitting
i have no fucking clue i need to ask my partner
i canât man i am driving back to toronto today i will be available after like 5
i will contact him to see how he did it
ya ok yo did you get this error when you did the csi3131 lab you sent a photo
you had no problem with gcc can i see your helloworldc
and where did you save this helloworldc
i have no clue why my thing is not working i am following the instructions of the lab i will find out on monday i guess
lemme check yo where is the csi3131 tutorial
which room
broodstarfrankhotmailcom
ok thanks
you going to the gym son
yo when a process forks the child and parent doesnt share anything right

ok thanks by the way
yo i got a question about joinc of lab 2 task 3 start  task 2 start  task 1 start  task 1 end task 2 end        task 3 end task 4 start  task 4 end
would you consider task 1 to be the child of tasks 2 task 2
ok yo how did you do joinanyc the output is task 3 start  task 2 start  task 1 start  task 3 end task 2 end task 1 end task 4 start  task 4 end
oh wait yes httpwwwartefactmagazinecom20171102whydosouthkoreanswantwhiteskin
does chinese girls do it too these koreans look like fucking ghosts
they are like whiter than the white guys here in north america
it is supposed to be at site but i aint going to class today they are just tutorials not very helpful
oh ya
ok
what is ok i mean it should be fine if it works right doesnt matter which os you are using
i am not the one working on lab3 my partner is he is using ubuntu and i think he is ok
ok
i need tictactoeh
you sent a photo i cant help you man there are too many things that are not working right now and i am a little busy
you ó°
something very boring i donât know it now cuz i am outside
what is your title
lol that is too specific man nobody will understand wtf that is
something like testing automation of a microservice in a network management control and planning solution but even for my report my title didnât have anything related to the content something like seg3901 coop report
thatâs what they said
that was an indisputably bad title though i would have failed that title too if i was the marker
yo is back extension designed to help you fuck
the motion reminds me of intercourse but yes i am only feeling burn in my leg
i had many about seven months ago
i ainât for sure lol i really donât know sorry
hope nope i gave up thinking for a solution i am gonna sit on it for a few days
oh ya do you know de way
i will look into it later tonight
i dont think it is sufficient to just use a series of waitsignal
i think in general solutions involving waiting for semaphroes in sequence will never work and so is the same for your solution imagine your veggie chef gets the meat
but it doesnt get the rice so it is a meat and rice day and lets say this veggie chef looks at the supermarket first your veggie chef will get stuck in the wait for rice
the next day
it will only check for rice
i mean if you can check like that then why cant you just do a check for whether rice and meat are there simultaneously i thought we arent allowed to do any checks
not really you can just do a check whenever the new day starts you will only check once per day i will get back to you another day
ok yo can you meet me outside of class to help me with the lab
alright yo
do you remember if the professor talked about multithreading
this is chapter 5 scheduling
it is on his lecture slide right so like is it worth studying
you know what is that is right
it is better if i understand it but i dont undersatnd certain concepts he discussed in slides but it is ok
no never had that problem but you gotta bike on the designated road canât bike on pedestrian
not yet when is it due
havent tested it out yet yo can you tutor me i dont understand os
are you in school now i am confused about everything starting from hierarchal paging
goddamn it are you free today after class
when are you available tomorrow
ok i will see i will let you know tonight
ya but i dont understand why hierarchal paging is better
they tried several different explanations but none of them make any sense to me
ok
i am interested in how it does that
ok i will meet you in class or outside yo did you do the assignment yet for csi
did you calculate the internal fragmentation and allocation efficiency for the first question
lol yo what did you say for question 2 did you say that implementing dynamic memory allocation requires you to know the maximum size of a process and you basically allocate whatever amount of space that process requires
dude isnât the whole point of a partition is that you can only allocate one process per partition you are allocating two programs to one partition
no i am talking about first question you are using m5 twice partition is the same as frame
well that is not what i read
we should talk later
you sent a photo you sent a photo each partition can only have one process
this is so fucked up honestly everything i learned from the book just gets disproved so easily
yo nvm good thing i asked you about this earlier i wasted so much time trying to figure out these answers
no i never tried to search for them because i am an honourable man who doesnt like to cheat unlike you pieces of shits who just look for answers directly from online fucking slackers
go get expelled from school you piece of shit
ya this textbook is so confusing
yo you finished the lab 5 right
oh nice how did you compile the code dude did you get any errors when you compiled the code
ok
how did you use eclipse
lemme try this out is this what you saw you sent a photo
ok great thanks for the direction
alright thanks yo can you help me with the lab my lru is dramatically better than the one in the lab example
alright
no it is on 30th and ya it is at 2pm
never tried it why is it important
what do you not understand
semaphore takes effort to program from scratch so people made monitors that performs the same functions as semaphores but monitors is well programmed and you dont have to worry about corrupting or misusing semaphores
semaphore is something of an os operation it is not very user friendly monitor is much more user friendly
condition variable is used to keep track of the condition of when a semaphore becomes available that is what the professor said in the last lecture but i dont think that is how it works
how are you studying for os
can you give me the link i am curious about them as well
ok cool yo make sure to bring the upass tomorrow
yo there are mistakes in the multiple choice banks right
yo how does paging access secondary storage
you know what it makes sense because virtual memory implementation requires that some pages be mapped to secondary storage
otherwise the logical memory space would be limited to physical memory space and majority of logical memory space would be mapped to spaces in secondary storage
lol gg how is your life
in what way ouch sorry to hear that son
you broke up with her
why though you donât like her anymore
i see
ye thatâs right i woke up in the middle of morning
ya no problem
ya i feel bad for the people who suffered because of the natural disasters no real problem in central here though
it is great
it is kind of like your lab job
i am designing a system to do experiments on human but i am also doing ml
i will likely use tensorflow
oh so you will be around for a while huh
wait but you might not stay in ottawa
oh really why mcgill
you know what that is actually true toronto is recently not very safe
but you might feel lonely there not many chinese in mcgill they mostly go to toronto and vancouver
lol you donât like chinese friends
ya immerse in the culture ya thatâs good i feel like my workplace is too much english now
there are a lot of japanese but of the people that i know speak english most of the people
not actively i always waited for them to talk to me but maybe one of these days i will chat with them you sent a photo you sent a photo you sent a photo
i took these pictures because the ladies in the pictures looked really good with the elegant dress
well i am a hentai no surprise there
i will upload more photos when i get more
i havenât had a chance to ask for numbers you just ask randomly on the street
it is really hard cuz there are barely any girls from work because it is easier to communicate to us and they can understand a certain level of english
but i have already seen many beautiful girls here on the street and work no most people go home around 5pm
ya i know i gotta work a litte hard but i am not used to just randomly going up to people
so i am expanding my social sphere so i can know more people
not alone
have you ever tried that
haha really maybe thatâs because you are sociable and handsome
lol did you go to bars just to meet girls
by yourself
i gotta make a friend first here
are you having any luck with girls over there this is your opportunity
lol dude is that the reason why you broke up
i see you are fast you got her pic
can i see it
dude she is good
she is from china or canada sorry what
maybe cuz you are sick of her
gg that is very romantic if you
and dude she is fucking in love with your dumbass i read the text
a litte
so like do you not like her anymore
isnât it more likely that you just simply donât appreciate your girl when you have her you donât feel like you need to put in any more effort
wait what
you touched her boob and kissed her and she isnât your girl does she think you are her boyfriend
she would be in ottawa now if you didnât like someone at that time
but that message itself doesnât say anything about your status
does she know you broke up
you never asked her if you guys are in a relationship
dude wtf
you know what that is fair
that you donât want to be in a relationship
everybody has their own way of going about a human connection and you happened to not want to be in a relationship and i can understand that
that looks pretty good some pretty girls there too
but this is not in china
wtf i see foreigners there
i donât
dude i donât know jack shit about china
yo i am gonna try to sleep again
next time i am back in ottawa maybe you and i can go to a bar to pick up some girls who knows
anyways later man nice catching up with you i will let you know if i find someone nice here
ya sure
ye ok you sent an attachment
np
everybody prefers to go to vancouver campus and it is closer to downrown
i donât know man but that is weird
for which one
application
ai
howthat is up to you man i donât know your motivation it is better if you can show off your interest in a concrete way donât just say that waterloo is prestigious
purpose
no this is purely your interest
yo how are you doing man how is life in canada
i cant fucking get a girl here it is frustrating i think i am gonna give up
i feel like it is not worth my time
i am using dating apps and i met real girls
the dating app didnt get me any girl and the real girls are not interested but i will continue to meet someone
i guess lol how are you man school treating you fine and how about your pseudogf
didnât you make out with a girl in china you were telling me about her a while back
lol ok so thatâs that
nice those are the big schools so that means you will finish at uottawa after next year may
well good luck on the application man if they are interested in you then you will be interviewed but of course you donât need to worry now
for graduate stusy
i thought they have interviews i guess not all graduate schools have it ubc had it
it is mostly for the graduate supervisors to get an idea who they are working with if you are working with a supervisor you will definitely get interviewed
then you wonât need an interview
i am enjoying the quality of products here mostly just food and i go around to events with acquaintances actually today i went to a high school cultural festival
that was very cool there were students doing presentations in english and some of them were high high quality lemme see you sent 2 photos
actually these are the only photos i took it is an international school so they wanted to show off their english speaking capabilities
there was even this really cute 16 year old girl who did a presentation like a ted talk her presentation was flawless i wish i took photo of her because she was truly amazing
ya i know that was why i went cuz it is in anime but this festival is not like those you see in anime it is actually far less exciting it is a lot more serious
yes this is a private international school yearly tuition is like 20000
oh yes there are i am watching sword art online you sent a photo and also this one
yes i like it too
haha yes he is funny sometimes
lol that would be nice wouldnât it but that ainât ever gonna happen yo your friend with glasses has a girlfriend do you know if they met here here as in canada
good for them do you know what the girl is doing
wtf she is fucking smart she is the girl with the tatoo on her leg right
i am talking about the guy with glasses who always chatted with us in os
his girlfriend also has tatoo but what did she study in master
lol i thought she was not well educated cuz she had tattoo
sorry not ânot well educatedâ but more like doesnât take life too seriously a very free person
are we talking about the same girl did he change gf like this was near the end of july
ok well i guess good for them i wish them a successful relationship after moving
do i know them
ok ya it is pretty insane how early people marry they sure are lucky to have figured out life partner so early
you lost interest in girls fuck does that mean you donât wanna fuck girls up
lol your dad called you about your relationship problem
ok man later
yes i did lol i wasnât actually allowed to take photos though
you sent a photo this was the only thing i could take photo of the green one is mine the rest were my acquaintanceâs but yo i am gonna go to sleep now
another time son have a nice day
lol i just woke up i got so fat how about you
i didnât gain that much but my belly got bigger whatâs the best way to get rid of belly fat i heard sprinting is a good way
what is a good sprinting speed
hmm i see
i also didnât have it when i rode bike everyday
but sprinting might be better it is good for the heart when you are burning fat in your belly do you feel a slight stomach pain
i donât know if it is muscle
but when i sprint i sometimes feel pain at the stomach region ya i donât do it after eating like 1 or 2 hours after
i see so burning stomach fat shouldnât be painful
i see then i will breath better next time then how are you doing man what class are you in
with girls i want a japanese girl now
you sent a photo all the girls here dress so nicely they look insane
i already tried but they donât like me
kind of i donât know my messaging contacts didnât really change how were you so popular with girls from university dude like girls would literally go chat with you on the bus
yes
yes normally when you are with me you seem kind of quiet but for some reason i get the feeling you are
i guess so did you ever have a girlfriend in canada
ok tough for you here huh
is that cuz you know lots of girls in china or you just know how to charm them
can you actually give me an example of one of your lines
lol daily life i donât know jackshit about daily life the only thing i know are science and engineering lol
they donât watch anime here i meant in canada and most girls here donât watch anime neither
of course it is i am a good listener thatâs not hard honestly
yo i gotta wake up now i mean get up and prepare for work
later son good luck with the final month yo man happy new year how is life
yo i am good man why did you change your name
lol what are you team captain
he might put down michael
ok cool
yes i have but nothing serious just school projects
no i dont know jni are you talking about junit
ok i dont know what that is
my work is doing great i wrote a deep learning model this past friday and i had it train over this weekend
i am very excited to see my result tomorrow you know deep learning right
it is for recognizing if an object is rigid based on a sequence of images lol uottawa ai class is nothing they dont teach you deep learning until graduate study
well good for you man did you like it
you gonna continue in ai
lol no i havent i gave up on hooking up here a long time ago
hooking up is for people who got people skills i dont got it
maybe it is your imagination yo you said you are going back to china to be a pro right are you gonna work for alibaba or tencent
i see and stay here in canada huh
it is not a terrible decision but the ai industry in china is getting big
if china could stabilize their situation i might consider going back to china
i recently started having an interest in speaking more chinese
i mean i can already have simple conversations and i can understand most of what people say if you are in uottawa by the time i come back i will speak in chinese with you probably
oh why is that they are too loud over there
lol that is capitalist society at its finest
well japan in general is better than nyc if you go purely by appearance but the people here are too weak
i mean nyc is a pretty multicultural place not very unexpected
yo i am gonna have to sign off now cuz i got to sleep for work tomorrow but talk to me again later maybe we should chat in chinese lol
dude i got a question did you receive a t4 tax form from ciena
lol
ok i guess that is all we can do for now eh
hey do you know if we did conjunctive normal form in class
great one less thing to study
you know the iti is due on friday now right
it is due next friday because the professor felt bad for me since my lab happened later than everybody else
yes a1 due next friday
it is on piazza
now it is due on the same day as iti1100 aint that nice ya
iwill pull it up for you httpspiazzacomclassiwpab14ycn6jocid65 i think this applies to all the sections
well not confusing anymore
there is only section bc on piazza there isnt a section a in piazza
you can search for it when you go to piazzas home page httpswwwgooglecawebhpsourceidchromeinstantion1espv2ieutf8quottawa20piazza20iti1121 go to the fourth search result let me know if it works for you
lol you mean his organization
haha ya i agree he just rambles on and on and on in class
i spend the time in class doing the assignment and i know a lot of the stuffs he is teaching so it doesnt bother me much but i can see how it can be very difficult for someone new in the fieldd
the lab
ya unfortunately i had hoped it would finish in 2 hours
no but i am gonna do taht today i would feel bad making you do all the work
i sure hope so all of this stuff is nothing but tedious to me i would much rather spend time on my personal projects
i am making a video game because i want to practice being a game developer
ya it really is which is why the homework is nothing but a drag for me
how is your weekend
lol
i was at my game dev club but then got tired after getting back home so i spent the majority of the time playing games so ya nothing accomplished i am reading over the logic slides though
oh comonlets not celebrate too early i thought you were the really diligent type hey do you know what homeworks cover all the stuffs we learned in discrete math
hmm ok
i think blackboard might make certain features more convenient for him or the students
oh my godthank you so much
i wanted to ask if you can provide it for me but didnt want to impose on your time
but some of them expires tomorrow i am gonna quickly fix up some resumes right now and submit before tomorrow
i see but the one you included at the enddamn that one fits my interest quite well if i get a job off of this then i am gonna owe you big time
thats ok this is more than enough
ya it would be nice if i can get into a game design company now but i will take what i can get when are your interviews by the way
good luck on them you mentioned one of them is not really programming related right
does the other one have programming
awesome hopefully you get offered at that one they probably gonna ask you lots of programming questions or algorithm questions
i think you should do some practice algorithms
httpsinspiritnetinbooksplacementscracking20the20coding20interviewpdf not sure if this is useful but i read on quora that it is a good starting point maybe at our level it is simpler
ya it was a group interview stuffs you learn and programmed in iti1120 is extremely useful are
lol aint that nice i am sure she is happy she also told us a story about another student who was a history major took the iti1120 class got a applied to google and got an interview
you mean your email made her day
unfortunately there will always be some of those outliers who wont do well in courses but a good professor can raise the course understanding of the overall student body but good for both of you
to be honest probably not i honestly could be a ta in this course and i am gonna apply to be a ta in iti1120 next year
haha is that right it seems though most of the helping tas give are just debugging codes if you got like 95 in iti1120 then you could probably be a good ta
hey do you know what we are supposed to read for the iti1100 lab
i actually just read the stuffs the instructions in the last dgd
hey you installed quartus ii right did you only download the quartus ii software
ok i will look into it in case you havent noticed i am completely clueless about all these administrative stuffs
ya no kidding its in the gb range so did you have to sign up to altera
hey did you remember the ta mentioning that they are looking for specific wordings for definition questions on the test do you
fill in the blank i thought you had to know the entire definition
oh hell no was this the programming job or the tech support
welp at least you can hope how was the actual interview though aside from the handshaking
i will talk to you in class but dont sweat it if that happened at the interview then it just means the same type of stuff is gonna happen if you work there
how do you do it in math term lol hey did you remember to use the nand nor xor in the prelab that was an expectedly tiring test nearly couldnt handle it while i was writing
and brain twisting toothat knight and knave question thoughthat was something else
i think we got different tests i confirmed this with the others i think they flipped it between our tests
or we could be all wrong
for mine b said that
honestly even if we make a mistake in that question it is not a big deal
glad to hear that have a nice weekend and lets not forget about the iti lab
you ó°
haha glad to hear that the lab was easy too
i dont remember do you want me to check
if you give it 37 it will crash if you give it n it will crash
ya i dont think we have to
well i am assuming
dont worry about the unicode
ya i was worried about it too for a while wasted some time thinking about it how was the interview
ya
but the ta told me i dont need to worry about it you sound like you have a hard time confronting people what did you guys discuss
are they interested in biology
lol he doesnt seem to know anything about how people go about schooling nowadays
yaschooling isnt the same as it used to be but i do hope that this will be my last degree and hopefully yours too
i cant even begin to fathom why you would want to do that but to each their own
absolutely hey have you done the assignment for iti
it is absolutely brutal you dont want to procrastinate on it
ya doing it now and it is giving me headaches
congrats to your sis
you dont have the questions
haha the anxiety
i am gonna try to finish this tonight work on the lab tomorrow so much work this semester
my book does
lol ya e 101011012 and did you buy your textbook from the store
problem solved thats what i thought too at first
you are very welcome hey do you want to discuss about our lab report before class
alright i am gonna start working on it now
ya no worries i recommend you to look at the example lab report on blackboard take care of the formatting and data processing sil tu plait
make it happen
like i said it is a bad example read the ridiculous discussion and conclusion you should include it if you can
how is the assignment going
this looks great thanks for doing it i will take care of the rest
well the rest is pretty easy
i havent done prelab but i will manage i appreciate your concern though um it is equivalent to a and b and then negating that result
now thats one smart idea bring two copies to class too
sure as hell is but i am sure you are smart enough to figure it out by the way do i need to get your student number for the cover page hey i do need your student number
no worries by the way i will send you the document after i finish but unless you say something i am gonna be the one to print it tomorrow
i am pretty sure it is due in the lab where did you read this info
i swear to god he said due in the lab i am gonna finish it today and bring it to the lab you dont need to worry about me you know what who is tarek is he our ta
goddamn
yalike this lab is not even that hard and one week seems like a decent amount of time to do it hey i just finished the lab report the lab is actually 1 not 2
how is the prelab going and by the way can you print out the lab report i dont want to spend money to print it in school and you got your personal printer
i actually just realized how long it is
do you wanna share answers tomorrow i dont care much about digital systems
which part are you on right now
i will do the prep for part 2 and you can do the prep for part 3 how does that sound
lets meet up tomorrow before iti1100 class starts at 1 lets meet at like 1230 or something
oh dang when is a good time then lol do you need someone to help you practice interivew
alright i can meet you then
i am gonna do the questions in the morning then we can combine the prelab
lets meet up i wanna see your side of the solution to prepare myself if that is ok with you is your interview at uottawa
ok well if it is not too much trouble lets meet
ya thats cool are you memorizing answers for interview lol
cool i guess they wont find it very pleasing if you dont know jack about their company
alright i am still working on my prelab made a mistake in the middle
tis is long hey if you are sure you didnt make any mistakes you dont need to send it to me i realized there isnt any point in getting prepared for the lab getting overloaded with work these days
lol suit ur self
well he is old
please do i totally forgot about it actually good that you reminded me
nice when you say everything you mean the iti lab report
haha ok thats what i thought too but we usually talk about school work i am looking into the coop jobs that you sent me i applied to rbc and blackberry so far
man you should be happy you have any interviews any at all
still worth it hey so can you upload the lab report
ok great and have a nice weekend
thanks
the one about change of classroom for thursday
i heard about it but i dont see that email right jow now
lol i mean we learn most of the stuffs from the lab and assignments
you can if you patiently listen to what she has to say but ya classroom learning is tough in this one i just finished part 1 if iti so proud of myself 1121 i mean
the assignment
it wasnt hard for me but i dont know about you
regarding iti1100
i feel that the concepts taught in that class feels too much like reading textbook because her slides are full of texts and not enough problem solving
exactly
probably cuz she is nice she seems like a fun person to be around
you want vida to teach everything
welp whatchu you gonna do you probably wont have anymore classes with her for the rest of your study in ottawa
my deepest condolence for you how was the lab yesterday
lol isnt he guy vincent jordan is he french
ya of course do you speak french
i kind of had the suspicion that you spoke french with a last name like lacompt and you said you lived in montreal before or was it quebec
cool by the way i applied to all the jobs that i could apply to that you provided thanks for providing me the list
molded by the professionals that sounds nice
hey remember to submit lab 1 si tu plais
lol so will you remember or not remember
thank you for your hard work
thank you i knew i could count on you
nah i am not but i gotta do some homework exercise or assignment to catch up
are you serious i thought you didnt want to go you can probably spend 35 hours reading the textbook to understand what she is gonna teach in class today and that saves you the effort of going downtown
maybe not enough rooms on campus we had our last lecture in the catholic church on laurier
dont know hopefully not how many people showed up in class
sounds like you had fun
my deepest condolence to you for going through with that what were you doing downtown by the way
nice
gonna look at it today if i dont fall asleep before then
but there is plenty of time before when wr have to hand it in so we dont need to be all that rushed
ya it sure as hell is gonna rip that discrete test to shreds
hey i got a question for you in discrete mathematics using the truth tree method taught in class is a and a a tautology or contradiction
ya
but the question is a and a
well it is actually neither a tautology nor a contradiction ya but the thing is if you use the truth tree method of negating the original statement you will only get open branches
ya but remember a and a is neither a tautology nor a contradiction so do you see the contradiction in your result
didnt he say in lecture that if all branches are open then it is a contradiction
regardless i will ask him about it on monday
well showing that all branches are open doesnt guarantee that it is a tautology
but i think he laid out a rule during the lecture that it is
but think about all of his other examples how did he prove things are tautologies
ok i see i think i know what i am missing
yes
but it hinges on that my note is wrong or our prof said the wrong things
nah its cool i will ask him during lecture
we will see it is actually not that big of a deal to me i am probably going to do well regardless of my knowledge of truth trees
lol i love shovelling i dont get much exercise so shovelling is a good opportunity to go out and you can listen to some atmospheric music while ur at it
thats nice too what podcast
well aint that nice all your hard work
ya we dont its not worth that much anyways we need to talk about how we are gonna do the lab report i will try to look into it tomorrow thursday is absolutely swamped for me
lol wait is the lab report not due this friday or is it due next friday
thank god
i got two interviews happening on thursday and got to do my entrepreneurial homework which is a lot and has to study for midterm for next week
i just need to read one more paper
ya it is a case study anyways good that we dont have to do the lab this week and also i think i spent too much time on the lab report last week it is probably worth about 1
you too how was the test
this test was friggin long for some reason the truth ð²
did you manage to check your test over because i couldnt
mental cramp on a test you gotta relax well i wont ask you more about it seemed like everybody had trouble
didnt check what questions did you take it slow on
yes you were a true fool but dont worry you can do better on the next test you let ur garde down
ya do well on the final
if it is too hard for you you dont have to force yourself
you should take mat1341 or maybe you already took it hey do you know if you have to say what law you are using when you are doing boolean algebra for iti1100
i see good time them good old days
you didnt have barry jessup i had a hardtounderstand prof too but i skipped all his lectures and went to jessups
super easy and he can engage you in class too you dont feel bored listening to him not many professors can do that
good choice but you know the assignment is due tomorrow too right
have fun with that
yup gotta cut off the slacks i cut mine off this past weekend it was a good decision and i honestly dont know what you spend all of your time on the weekend to be so unproductive
i see are you better
maybe thats why you messed up the test
was it a normal cold should wear more clothes if it is
well you should i got cold like 3 times last semester because i got exposed to cold frequently wearing more clothes solved the problem
i think that is felt by 99 of the students in university
maybe i am underestimating that number i dont know somebody out there who love what they learn and enjoy classes
ya you seem like the diligent type pretty organized too just feel that you do your assignments pretty late
haha i see as for me i absolutely hate pressure so i try to do things as early as possible
tinkering is not a bad thing it means you love the work you do but unfortuntately there is no space for tinkering in university course works
yes but i still need to add comments
why
right i think as long as you can get it to compile you probably did fine any trivial mistakes you make wont affect the grade that much probably
you know what else should be all labs every course
we dont need to learn stuffs from lectures
lol you have a good sense of humor
aww poor allie but you got 5 other ones lined up
well that is even better oh wait not really if you dont want 2
oh man that sounds brutal if you say it like that you can hope
i have faith in you that you can get one because you are a fast learner and diligent
ya i dis you probably will get ð¯
isnt that just included in the overall mark man you seem so anxious take it easy
you can get stuffs in between 75 and 50
lol i got a story in iti last semester i panicked after seeing a 030 on my midterm then when i talked to vida it turned out to be 2930 blackboard bug
anybody who wasnt suspicious would have passed out after seeing that
i always double check so i didnt believe that
that i can kind of imagine what you feltbecause i felt them except i wasnt meant to get a
well you know somebody in your class got a c
lol what witchcraft
are you interested in supernatural
or you were just interested in the history
holy shit for some reason you appear like someone who would be into that kind of stuff
sorry i meant i dont know enough about you and you seem mysterious so it wouldnt contradict any image i had of you if you were actually into witchcraft
is that right
i suppose they would be clever i thought most witches were hunted down for the purpose of political witch hunt no pun intended
anyways the reason why i had a huge reaction to that was because i have been interested in supernatural stuffs for a while now but recently i am becoming more skeptical
i read hp and i wouldnt do a course in a subject i like unless it allows the students to do free style research or free style project i can do that stuff on my own
especially if they gave you a c when you should have gotten a
most certainly yo i am actually gonna get back to work i am sure you got a lot of stuffs done during this chitchat
certainly
just had my first one this one requires reference letters but i dont have good relationships with my past bosses i will see if they are going to give me references
ya but whatever if they are going to reject me based on that then i got nothing to feel about it
any luck on jobs
congratulations
whats the company name
what do they do
wow looks legit did they need a reference
did any of your companies needed a reference
oh i see well you are good to go
you are not that awkard and you are nice to people
there you go
goddamn that place is far i went there today to tutor a kid never again just came back after staying in freezing cold for nearly 30 min
a little hick district called marconi
ya ive crossed march i am not familiar with the geographics but man i aint going there again
thats actually where most of ottawas high tech companies are at actually they are not in downtown
lol they dare call that silicon valley the nerve on these people
hey do you know if all future prelabs are going to be done as a group or individually
i just finished the prelab you dont need to worry about it unless you think i am incompetent and would like to do it yourself
aint a thing
riht
didnt we already finish it oh wait no just the same old stuff i will take care of the data analysis this time it is worth less than 1
if you want take a look at the prelab
no
did you
hey by the way can you print out the prelab
thanks did you finish your assignment 2
i wrote some of my own
i havent checked it i have no idea
great
awwww that is sweet of you
to be honest it is a difficult offer to turn down
you know what i will take that offer and i will take a look over it
have fun with it
yes
to be honest i dont even take any notes in that class so it doesnt matter to me that much
lol then you got nothing to worry about is there
did you end up going to a different iti1121 class
well every class is note worthy but i can explain it to you in like 10 minutes
nope
you just read the lecture notes i think yo mu are good
i got the job by the way the one where i did a lot a work
i was happy that my effort paid off and slightly excited
it is just a place to get paid and get reference letter but it is a resource nonetheless so i am happy about that
like a little kid going on a trip
i think you wouldnt like coding if any other teacher taught you
well good thing that you end up liking it i know people who end up not liking coding because of shit professors
if only they learn coding on their own
yo speaking of if only how was discrete math lol i made a mistake on the only if question on the midterm
haha nice and you were saying you needed to replace that test
i knew you were wrong
yo you had fun with the iti1121 lab
you are still doing it this is the most ridiculous shit i have ever done the instructions dont even qualify as helpful i think you were talking about the iti1100 i was talking about iti1121
ok i will take a look now i can give you some idea i thought that was pretty cool one of the experimental result also showed how pos or sop forms of a circuit generate the same result
ya please say those explicitly do you know how to write a nand only expression given a truth table
hello allie did you read my last question
what you do is get the pos of an expression and negate it no actually you get the sop and you double negate
anything new that we learned in the lab we gotta state it explicitly in the discussion and explain what is cool about what we learned
you can say so amazing in a matter of fact way it is just a common practice for writing reports of any kind but you definitely need to at least state the key learnings explicitly
ya it was an ez lab but the instructions to do it were ridiculously unhelpful
everything was vague lol unfortunate
as long as you got the dot to move then you are fine
then you got nothing to worry about
i didnt have to implement the colors i didnt want to stay in the lab longer than 2 hours are you ok with the discussion i should write the discussion next time if it is your least favorite part
i only got the dot to move thats it and the quiz too but nothing else what do you mean lied the discussion
in discussion you get to be creative
i only submitted the displayarea and gui files
from part 2 i didnt do part 1 no part 3
i think i am cool this stuff is worth less than 1 and i am confident that you will bring glory to us but next time i will write the discussion
if you finished i suggest you to submit now
thank you for your hardwork
have a nice reading week
hey just to let you know i am not going to work on the prelab until tonight but you are more than welcome to finish the prelab for us by tomorrow morning if i dont finish it by then
wait what i thought over the reading week people were running the part 2 of the lab
like i know they said our last lab has two parts but i thought the second part happened over the reading week
lol alright i guess taht is one less thing to worry about i was reading the shits for lab 4 just now
well i got a presentation tonight gotta work on that how was your reading week mine was surprisingly unproductive i promised myself i would complete way more than what i actually did over the week
yo i normally dont ask people this but i am wondering if you wanna work together on 1121 unless you already got a partner i am stressed out from these tests and assignments
dont worry about it it is actually quite simple but do you think we can work on it over the week before the exam i already finished part 1 we just need part 2 and 3
well i am already working on the assignment yo it is up to you whether you still wanna work with me but at this point i have put down the resolve to finish the assignment on my own
right
well it is a lot more work than assignments 1 and 2
ya uh oh is right
probably
that page that says guis are not on it is out of date we did gui two weeks ago i think it is fair for gui to be on the test
what was from 5 days ago
oh ok
i was looking at the past exam page i didnt see that notification
ok then i guess i dont have to work on this assignment anymore i was just getting in the zone on it though oh well
had a feeling that was gonna happen
you gotta hire good people to do work you know they should have taught java in 1120
i was just thinking that lol but she probably wouldnt have any experience teaching this course either
i dont know who were teaching all the students from 1120 like they could have gotten the same professors to teach 1121 whatever look i aint interested in all that stuff now i got stuffs to do
ya i appreciate that thank you hey so you know what is an external gate do you know
some of the assignment questions are on it
the textbook only mentioned external gates a few times before chapter 4 and i think the external gates are the gates used to generate the output
right so the decoder only generates the minterms and the external gate is used to combine them together in an or statement i got it
wait so active high are or gate
i have no idea why they give such weird names thats the whole reason why i am confused but whatever
i dont know the difference i thought they are the same

high doubt it hey did our prof say what the test is going to be on for 1121 lecture wise
that makes no goddamn sense but ok
how was the 1100 test
aaaaaalright
there was an example did you see that
the first question you had two rows in the truth table
ya it was a generously easy test the actual test wasnt even that hard but she still decided to add 30 worth of bonus when i heard that my bullshit meter was going nuts
ya ð¤·ââï¸
i will be ready by tonight or by the time we write the test tomorrow
ur the smart girl you will be fine
it went well 95 do you want to do the data processing or do you want me to do it i can do the processing just thought to ask since you said you like it better than discussion
thanks hey do you mind if i get a copy of your notes for the last thursdays discrete math class
if the resolution is good enough you can just take a picture with your cell but thanks a lot i really appreciate it skipped that class cuz of cold
i dont need it at the moment i just need it before the next test
thanks
lol lemme check it lol i did bad on this one class average was low too i wonder which part i made a mistake on
i didnt have a problem with room
wow this test was worth 25 i guess i gotta try hard then from now on
there wasnt any of that in the past tests i want to know what mistake i made though i am curious
ya i did i should have friggin checked my answers i had 17 minutes left were the last two pages blank i finished up until that modifying the statistics class
no i did finish that question so that means i didnt miss any questions
ya how did you do
nice
i thought i did well too but i am really curious to see what i did wrong
dont they hand that out in class
we will see
lol who knows that is possible i am not too worried i just gotta catch up and take this more seriously i am working on 1100 right now
let me know how it goes
nope
alright
when are his classes
that actually sounds nice i might go to the wednesday and friday ones where are they
lol really ok
hey are you gonna be the one to do the prelab i havent started yet and i probably wont have it done until tomorrow late in the morning
alright and yo i just got switched to software so now i dont need to worry about gpa or coop anymore
ya
and i was worried about my grade for this semester too after that last iti1121 midterm this news came at a nice time the timing couldnt have been better
ya it sure is i feel really light now i almost feel like not trying anymore
you gonna put me on a leash you can do that tomorrow in the lab
i will try but not enough to put stress on me
the excitment still not up for me
how did you do you seem eager to talk about it
gud luck on 3
what
i wasnt implying its difficulty
seems you did fine i just skimmed over it i got a good idea of what needs to be done for todays lab as well
yo thanks how is 1121 going i am barely done just now
well if you need any help let me know i can explain stuffs to you which might make it faster
i am here now
doesnt seem like it
yup this is the one thanks i will take care of the lab report the rest of it i mean you just focus on iti1121
for sure
dont worry too much about it i just submitted the report
i checked it over and i dont think you missed anything
they are worth 25 points each not a big deal
whatever you say not very worried
lab report you sent an attachment
how is 1121
great
ya there isnt
did you like not sleep at all last night
well you are making fast progress
or maybe i am just imagining it
yes
i won many times
well you can win the game by randomly picking colors i dont know why you sound like you lost the game cuz that is impossible
oh i see that is hard
ya
i didnt  bother with any border layout i think that is the default layout for the frame
how do you know
if you send me a screenshot of your code for making the jframe i can take a look
have you tried to resize the jbutton i think they are rectangular by default so you have to set them to a square dimension
show me the code for how you set the gridlayout
if you fixed the problem then all is good but i had set mine to size x size size  size of the board maybe the constant value was giving you problem
nice more time to slack off
the bad thing is i dont know anything about sequential circuit
good stuff yo since this is a two week lab are you planning to use the time to study for discrete math instead
i think we should go to the lab and confirm that we can skip then we skip
i dont know anything about a sr latch
and the lab is asking us to find the function table ok we will try then there is actually still some time until the lab we did well on the lab reports by the way
um one is 97 but ya practically perfect
yes
ok i am not gonna focus on that now
ya sure i honestly feel like i am not doing any work when i write the discussion but ya i can take that
alright there is one file that i havent sent you yet i will look it up and forward it to your email
just sent
ok lol did you check your exam mark for 1100 that exam was a joke they were too generous with the bonus
you cant get over 100
but honestly i probably did lol
i dont think i made any mistakes
no we dont
who cares as long as we do well
well aint that an admirable attitude
i nearly forgot about it
lol sorry to hear that hope you get well
i will take care of the rest
probably wont
i am about to submit this just submitted
ur welcome yo do you want to collaborate for assignment 4 for iti i gotta work on other stuffs and this assignment is taking too long i am about 65 complete
nope so what do you say
ya thats what i am thinking when do you think you can finish it
ok try to finish it early sunday night i am expecting monday to be hell for me
my entrepreneur class everybody in my team works last minute
no it is just always hell
this has been going on for the past 6 weeks or so
lol ya they are not very good teammmates
yup thank god
ok good luck
hey this is the assignment 4 source and data files i will send you an invitation as well to form a group
ya to form a group for this assignment i thought there is a way to do that but i guess all you need is to put down information of your partner in the submission
i came from uoft and they have a way to do group submission for all of their compsci assignmentsuottawa is far behind i guess you sent an attachment
i forgot to mention for the first remark that after you move the variables you need to add getter functions to gamemodel to get the torus and diagonal states of the game you then have to appropriately modify components in gamecontroller that used the torus and diagonal variables
i think i might fix it for you because it is an easy fix for me and it can save you a lot of time but you will have to figure out the second remark
ok so this version actually fixed all of the problems that i had before so you can safely start the last part of the assignment dont worry about the remarks i sent you before
yo everything cool with the assignment
ok good to hear
ok sure show it to me tomorrow if you can
yo how is the assignment
yo can we meet up today before discrete
when is a good time for you
ok that is good
i am worried about the diagonal is everything else working oh we should meet in the lobby right outside our discrete class
yo you wanna do the same thing for the final assignment i work on it at the beginning and you work on it near the end
well you dont need to feel this way thats all i can say lol
did you use radiobuttons
alright
well if everything worked out in the end then it should be fine but we will discuss about the diagonal what is the nature of the problem
did you modify the capturing algorithm
ok we will see what the problem is was it working fine before you made modifications to the code
are you sure you are not imagining the issue it might be capturing properly but you are not aware that it is because of the weirdness of capturing diagonally
ok i just read the instruction and you are right i literally only captured the diagonals lol but that is an easy fix
no it is not working properly if you havent changed the old code
but once again it is an easy fix
ok
i wont but i have something else to work on
but i can give you some quick instructions on fixing after class alright later
ya
its cool hey i am not sure if the version of the code i sent you has this problem
no
i think that is something the player has to figure out
i feel that way you are over assuming what the player wants to do what if the player wants to capture that dot orthogonally first and then from those captured dots capture diagonally
lemme read the instruction yo i think you should not do that imagine if the player has like 3 captured dots and then he turns on torus or diagonal now he has 7 captured dots
ya but like if you revert back to the current mode will you release those captured dots revert back to normal mode i mean
i hope that makes sense
you only need it while capturing could have made it local
but you are popping some elements out of that stack so you wont have a record of all your captured dots
ok
nah i trust that you got this i just realized you were talking about assignment 3 because the marks are up it sounds like you are bitter ð
lol
actually send me a copy of the code in zip file i want to keep it for the sake of record
and for whatever reason i couldnt find the corrected version of the files that i sent you on my hard drive
get rid of them
can you send me the zip file
yo there is a function for checking if game is finished please use that redundant code will cost us marks
ah right
i guess we did keep track of that i never used that variable
got it
why is that a problem we are a group did you also put down your information in the readme oh you meant you used other peoples solution
lol what are you worried about
ya go ahead
ok great stuff
aint a problem
i guess the same as usual
i think in piazza the professor mentioned he doesnt have that feature in his version
actually wait that is a different post where does it say the settings should also be undone
also after looking at the code you forgot to remove the instance variable settingswindow do you have a good idea of how to fix this issue
ok is it alright if i leave everything to your hand tonight i can answer questions if necessary but i wont bother modifying our code
well if the instruction says they are then it should be it is incredibly explicit i dont know how i didnt catch that
lol no way that is undoable
ok as long as it works
ok great then submit again
you know for me handing stuffs in is more of a sign that i am no longer interested in working on this work rather than my satisfaction with my work and i think this situation very much fits that description
naturally
no
ya alright no problem
well you dont need to be i am not in a hurry and it is only 1 mark so
you got the good stuff ya
its a joke
by the way whoever was supposed to be my substitute ta for 1121 didnt show up today did you experience anything similar with your old ta
well anyways i am submitting lab5 now here it is
yo i finished up the first 70 of the 1121 assignment the assignment this time is pretty damn easy do you want to do this separately or do you still wanna work together
alright i think we can both benefit from doing the full assignment and no lab tomorrow
things are getting more and more chill these days
i thought i would have a 3 hour class tonight but i turned to be cancelled
nice guess you have lots of free time
right
the person misremembered the time and there is going to be a replacement lab
possible i already completed most of the lab ready
no
nope dont need em
i dont care about getting the highest mark on the exam just high enough you should go if you think it is useful i personally never found them useful and i got other stuffs to do
i am not a good person to ask that question cuz i dont find any of the classes that useful they are mostly there to keep me up to date
ya you too
lemme check nope
anytime
havent gotten back anything from them in a really long time
you should contact then
no they are not on the exam decoder and multiplexers are
i just looked over past assignments and lecture slides they make sense to me and i memorized all the stuffs that need memorizing honesty didnt even spend that much time studying for this
ya pretty much how about you
have fun with that
i dont think i am worried about this test as much as you are
you have to make a tons of mistake on the final to get that grade
you have close to 100 on the other 50 of the course right you need to get 80 to get a 70 to get a and 60 to get a
ok i dont think i will make that much mistakes
well i believe i do it is ridiculous worrying about marks at our age i feel it is meaninglesa there are more important things in life than marks
haha you are right about that it is funny because i spent like some 16 years of my life hellbent on getting good marks but now i am super chill
yup it sure as hell did
lol thanks
i think may 10th i am going on a vacation with my family after exams
ya it would be los angelea angeles have you been there before
it is going to be hot as hell but it will be a novel location are you working right away
lol
no time for break
yo they want you well i cant say that for certain but i dont think they will unhire you and not hearing back from them is not a reason to worry
well lets hope they dont do that but if they did you can tell them they just lost one of the brightest computer scientists from uottawa imagine their reactions
but if they decide to be you know what to do
great how did you like the test ð
haha ya all of the clarifications were clear from the instructions and prior knowledge dont know why they had to ask all of them dumb qs but she did give us extra time
did you know how to do 1s complement method i had no idea what that was i just converted the numbers to 1s complement and practically bullshited the rest of that question
welp we are done with this course
aint nothing to be done now
ya aint bothered by it none
7 days from now
and everyone after that is spaced out in 3 days ya super chill
i am gonna go watch a movie in theatre now
tanks you take it easy too
nope didnt know ur welcome how is your study so far i havent done anything productive since 1100 exam
haha nice my motivational level is at an all time low after i started reading this comic and played some fun games
japanese comic
i used that word instead of manga cuz i know you arent familiar with it ya it sure does
is that right ok thats good to know
ya that was my plan too but i think you have more time than i do until the next test
it is not 1121
ok
ya wouldnt that be great
haha ð aint the a fun time
alright i am gonna get my breakfast and go study
i will do my best have fun with your studying as well i realized i just messed up that question with the stacks and queues it wouldnt work with primitive types
if they are marking using templates then i think my method is fucked i just checked and it is actually there lol
yeea hey i need to ask you a question about math why is the set of all binary relation on a finite set a is paxa i thought you form the binary relations by matching elements
right
so if you have a  123 then the set of all binary relations would be 12 13 11 21 right
that makes no goddamn sense
so you are telling me that 12 13 21 is a binary relationship
assuming they all exist in r
but a binary relationship is a pair of elements is it not arb
a and b are elements
but in the example i just gave you there are 3 elements
ok
i understand it now
so basically when they say a binary relationship they are referring to the set of all pairs that satisfy that relation that is fucked up
ya i get jt i am triggered now they never referred to it in class that way
no you are right
that was the answer on test 4 what have you been doing
lol you aint sure
oh ok
it is like a war of motivation
well i am worried after that last exam so i am studying hard and i am meeting a bunch of people before the exam so i got to use my time efficienty
lol the smart girl is worried that she wont get perfect
oh ya i think i will need a to ensure that i get in software they are still evaluating my decision so i cant afford to slack off
i need 88 on the exam
well i got lower than 88 before on midterm so i am gonna try hard nice ocd
it is stressful and nobody likes that
i had a friend asking me for advice regarding stress yesterday
do you do yoga
goddamn
i am disappointed in myself for being told by somebody else about stress i thought i knew all about handling stress thanks for the reminder
happens to us once in a while and need the occasional ass whuping by a friend to remind us what life is all about
well i need the grades to get me in a position to maximize my learning after i get in software i wont give a shit about grades anymore
computer science students have less options available for them after they graduate i mean
that is debatable
but i wont debate it because i love studying so much i want to go back to discrete
freedom as in courses you gonna take some art courses
i guess it is good for you if you dont have a solid idea of what you want to do yet for me i am dead set for software i know i want it
you should be a master programmer
i will hire you if i start my own company
it is just a term i coined but a master programmer aims to advance their knowledge in programming to the deepest level in many fields
if you manage to become a master you will have the opportunity to tackle many frontier computational problems i think that should be every programmers dream
lol you can try asking her once you get to that level
you can try hackerrank during your free time it can improve your programming skill
i am gonna get back to studying because i love it so much
later then
grade for 1121 is out psa
i got a
now that is a burden off my shoulder i am sure i got a on math too
i hope i hope it doesnt get stalled in the sea of bureaucry bureaucracy
ya sure as hell wont be if nothing unexpected happens then i dont see any reason why i wouldnt get in seg i can probably be rest assured that i will get in
ya nothing really but worrying about stuffs run in my family it is not good
i am surprised you tried so hard this semester you are in your desired program so there shouldnt be a need for you constantly worry about stuffs
i think you should do some side projects and not worry too much about classes theory is good to know but it doesnt offer you much in practical experience
i thought you had time during the school year with only four courses and all ð
well i hope you make some time for it during this summer
i got in software just letting you know since i talked a lot about this with you hope everything is going well with your new job
oh hell ya a burden off my shoulder i can now do coop that and taking courses that i can learn important stuffs the feeling that i am not wasting another 3 years learning useless content
it actually starts at the end of this month so i got some time to relax and do some of my own stuffs like learning 3d modelling how is your job
oh my fucking god that is fantastic the best job ever i wonder if i could work from home
oh just for today
i just misread that and thought you work from home everyday
ya sure as hell is
do you guys chat at all when you are working
i think socializing and sharing ideas at work is the fun part of working in a team
do you enjoy working with them or is it just another job for you
you should enjoy it as much as you can is all i am going to tell you
i thought that was pretty self explanatory
well i will be working in an academic research laboratory and academic laboratories typically have lots of politics like who to take order from who is the boss who is superior all kinds of stuff
ye but none of that in the tech industry everybody is just doing the things they love and is working together to achhieve a single goal that atmosphere do not exist in academia
well unless i find a future job where i get to be the boss this is probably going to be my last job in academia so i will take the frustration and it is only 12 weeks
and the reference and prestige i can get from this will be worth it anyways i will chat with you later dont wanna bother your important work and have fun
yo how are you doing these days i am bored out of my mind at the moment from working
for the most part
i am wrapping up my work right now by writing a report but that is incredibly boring as you probably experienced i am looking forward to having more free time in school honestly not the classes
you got like two more weeks though right
so you got time
how do you feel about your work experience
i gotta double check but ya that is pretty much expected for a software job actually that could depend on where you work ceg2136 csi2110 eco1192 seg2105 do we have any classes in common
tell me your section s
ceg2136	a02	2017 fall term ceg2136	a06	2017 fall term ceg2136	a00	2017 fall term csi2110	a02	2017 fall term csi2110	a00	2017 fall term csi2110	a05	2017 fall term eco1192	a00	2017 fall term seg2105	a02	2017 fall term seg2105	a00	2017 fall term
well good luck i am not sure if i will ever take that
i gotta double check my course schedule if i ever have to take it but actually c sounds like i will but i certainly will not take that next semester maybe in the future i will
oh cuz you are in science
you jsut gotta do what the university tells you to do aint no way around it well smokes i am gonna get out of here now and god knows i need to avoid the crazy traffics
yo what is your lab section for ceg
so we do have some classes together again very surprising
ya sure absolutely
i will need your help getting perfect on everything again
oh hell naaaaw
so we only have ceg and seg together but your time table looks like a work of art filling the morning slots perfectly
why not keep it
oh i see ya you dont need five courses
sorry thanks for what
oh right lol i got a lot of free time this semester too thanks to four courses i will be working with the summer job people online to get a paper published
yeah
i dont appreciate it that much though i am doing it out of a sense of responsibility you got one though
aint that the truth
yes
wrong class i went to site first and then just arrived at the correct classroom cby b02
oh lol that is quite late
well finish it quick then lol
you need to form a team here a team of 4 all you do in this lab is to make sure that people have set up the github
yo how are you going to the seg class from morriset taking the shuttle
when do you have to leave the class to reach them
so when are you leaving class
ok i need to go with you cuz i dont know where the shuttlebus is at
text me when you are about to leave
hey allie can you help proof my resume for coop
well i already got it approved but i they apparently want me to have it proofed anyways before i actually start applying hey did we ever have the conversation about the jobs available on the coop placement
so maybe we didnt talk about it but i heard from some people that the jobs offered in the coop navigator are not very goos good do you have anything to say about it
google and microsoft
i meant ones that are incredibly high level
i am mostly asking this now because i have no idea what i should be doing now apply to jobs or work on my personal project
next monday
no it is a long term game development project working on it now wont help with job searches but i  figured out what i got to do now
certainly will it is gonna be a long process
if i spam resume then yes but i have ocd and it takes a long time for each one
no for that i wont but if i look for jobs outside of navigator it will take a long time
hey are we working together for seg lab
yes i would absolutely like to
lol are you for serious how is that possible
because you knew everything and he assumed you were just there to help
lol that guy is probably the same age as you if not younger
well i am more curious about how those students didnt listen to you were they like super confident what they were doing or something
you gotta bring out your mental whip and show them whose boss
yo sorry i was out helping somebody but ya git is hard stuff for beginners and i will see you around tomorrow probably in all of my classes
well there are three sections in this lab so maybe that is true
maybe you are right i just applied to like 65 jobs on navigator hopefully i get some of them
do you remember how many you applied to hey are we supposed to finish part 1 and part 2 of the lab as the prelab
and are those applied over several rounds
lol that is basically all of the the jobs available in the navigator
what do you mean by round 1 first round of interview
first round of interviews consists of several rounds of job postings right and under the prelab it says to complete part 1 and part 2
so are you gonna do part 1 and part 2
you mean in the lab or as a prelab
good night then
ya i spent like 30 minutes this morning working on a school computer cuz my computer cant run quartus
first floor cby
yes
ok tianren wang
ok thanks for setting this up
hey i am trying to clone the repository for seg onto my computer but it is keep telling me that your repository dont exist even though i see it in the web browser
thanks
shouldnt be an issue
ok possibly just do it again and i will try later
no just sometime soon
thanks
good night
oh goddamn
riight
httpsgithubcomtianrenwang
you got it successfully cloned just got my first interview
ranovua ranovus allie missed your video chat sorry wrong button
they do cloud computing and large data stuff hey when is the due date for the ceg lab report
next next monday
and damni cant believe there is actually so much stuff going on
lol it is 25th i guess we have to work on it then
ok
ð so much stufc nope i dont have the class right now so you will just work on the figures that we need to submit in the report and comment on them as you see fit
good partners are hard to come by i am gonna do the cover page
i will be the one to merge our stuffs together and submit as final report so you need to send me your stuff after you finish
i also have a proposal for the seg assinment lemme do the first part and you do part 2 having one of us working on one part keeps the code consistent
oh wait i havent seen what you ahve done for part 2 lol so you already did part 2
ya seems like you already did
can you make a new repository so that the folder only contains contents of the first assignment
yes please do that
and call the repository seg2105 a1
ya but when i clone the repository it makes a folder called seg2105 in my seg2105 folder
and i dont want to constantly worry about adding new files into the repository that has nothing to do with the assignment
thanks oh ya also you dont need a subfolder called lab2 the labs are not for marks only the assignments are and the labs are just there to help people get started on assignments
yo did you take down the repository cuz i cant find it anymore
lol do you know where i can find it i cloned it just this morning and now i cant find it
it is but it is weird that i cant find it on github
i have to go to the invitation that you sent me to find the repository otherwise i cant find it on my profile
ya this morning i could
yo you mentinoed that the code for the different designs are already working properly right
i am gonna test them out now for their efficiency i dont know how i do that
doesnt matter i can already see your codes
ok yo there needs to be some changes necessary for seg the rotatepoint function in pointcpd2 is not implemented the way it should be all you had to do was add rotation to theta because theta is the angle
the same problem with the pointcpd5polar
you sent an attachment i just sent you the java class that tests the efficiency of each design i also got the testing data from it already and writing up the discussion
please do a different implementation what is the problem if theta is greater than 180
sorry what
it is fine as long as you avoid using the trigonometric functions because trigonometric functions take up more time than other simple math functions
and you can calculate the new rotation using modulus i believe but how do you know that the angles range between 180 to 180
have you done anything with ceg
thats ok
this is what i got you sent an attachment probably the final version
ok
you made the last edits you can submit
and happy birthday not sure if you saw my message
dont forget about ceg
great stuff
yo sorry to disturb you on your birthday night but did you do the prelab for lab2 yet  oh wait we only need one copy of the prelab hey this is the discussion answer i wrote for seg assignment
yes i didnt jot it down though
probably you an definitely ask him
by the way did you have royale with cheese
how did he feel about eating something from pulp fiction
sounds like a delicious burger
yo i forgot to ask you about seg assignment what is going on with that
everything ok with seg
great
ok is there something i can do for you
yes i believe our way makes sense
abstract classes do not necessarily need instant variables and in our case we made the decision to declare the instance variables in the subclasses that should be a valid decision
the thing is you are supposed to implement design 2 and 3 with design 5 and those two designs are not supposed to be able to switch between types
and so it doesnt make sense to have the two types in one class
the assignment has been very unclear and he is basically promoting a free style of implementation
yes that is what i am saying we dont need to worry about implementing a specific style nope yo you took care of the assignment right
ok good
i didnt receive no email yet i will check it later
ok no problem
you sure are hey have you ever done an interview that is labelled as test
ok i have one labelled as test instead of as an interview and i am assuming they just want to see how good i am at solving problems on the spot
i did not know that that is madness well lets get that stuff over then just send me the usual stuff
and i will format it
nope i thought it was monday too
well we can either finish it today or finish it off on monday doesnt make too much of a difference
how is your part of the report progressing
you moving again
what makes you wanna move
that seems to be a common problem in a lot of places
lol that is an important correction ok so now i am really confused about part 1s circuit it goes from 0  2  6  3  5  4 could have just done 0  1  2  3
kind of late but here are some of the stuffs from the oscilloscope you sent an attachment you sent 2 photos dont think we would need the csv file that is something we need to add to the observation
i think i will leave the merging and final submission to you but i am available for help and questions
can you take care of it
thanks partner
everything cool we happy
i trust you
not a huge expert on apartments but i mean it looks fair
ya you should do it if you are interested
but 1300 seems like a lot
ya thats what i thought too i was wondering why you would message me about me
you are welcome hey so i am looking over the prelab for tomorrows lab but i want to know who is gonna do the write uo up
i mean a prelab like what we do before every lab
alright
i am reading it as well just to be prepared for tomorrow
right well good luck on it lets hope it goes smoothly tomorrow i have been skipping so much classes lately because of my sickness i am really behind on coursework now but i dont want to study
do you know what ceg midterm covers up until
you know what i take part of the blame for being sick but i attended miguels lecture even when i was sick
cuz i knew it was informative
yo what is the company that you worked during the summer
ok hey do you understand the prelab
where are you can i ask you some questions
lol ok
2
i am not going to class today because i seriously need to just let my body rest but can you please let me know what the midterm for ceg covers
thanks
appreciate it
i will certainly try hey tell me about what you learned in ceg exam wise
lol so what is on the exam chapter 1 3
nothing on chapter 4
ok great
i havent checked i am studying for ceg now and his slides makes no sense
not just that but the contents are sometimes contradictory
lol man i am so mad at the stuffs happening in this course
like i didnt pay the amount of money that i paid to learn from this piece of shit and to have tas that get annoyed with us when we dont properly understand laboratory materials that are so poorly explained
nope
yo have you started seg assignment 2
alright i am working on it now by the way what did we get for assignment 1
partber oh no
it is not partner based
i was just curious i am stuck at the start
good to know
are you going to complain about it to the ta
ok good get us that 100
good luck on your inquiry and thanks for doing the work
thanks
dont think i did yup got nothing
damn
well smokes we got it
yo i am gonna work with ciena got matched with dem
thanks they are in kanata though so the transportation is going to be tough
this is going to take me more than an hour but you know what i have handled long commute before
for 4 years i did so this is really nothing
well aint nothing to be done about that working for great companies comes with its  sacrifices
yes many many
you bet
you can modify the server or the client
but if they hint at only modifying the client then the correct solution is modifying only client
you should do what you gotta do
hey when you get to class can you tell me the attendance code
thanks
ok
yes this is like such a subjective course that i am losing motivation to study lol
but honestly it would be favorable to you to not worry aboout your grade for this course spend your time on things that are more productive
thats what i decided
ya well his lecture is improvised a lot on the black board
ya
i thought it was alright i nearly couldnt finish
haha ya that one took a long time
oh hell ya this is our time
how did things go in the lab
how is our states not right
send me those diagrams so i can analyze them
possibly
ok
no we donât
ya same just woke up and donât wanna rush to class
you shall or you must or you will
dont worry about it when is this thing due
so i am just analyzing the data we got and writing a discussion and summary right
as long as you get it done at a reasonable time sometime tomorrow i can write it up pretty fast i got a good idea of what we did too
ya these are huge drags amplified by tas that are intimidating
maybe who knows i know i got a whole semester of miguel garzon waiting for me in the summer so that is going to be fun
hahaha you think so i will find out i wish he organized his notes better
ya that is an important point
if he had organized his notes better then he wouldnt be making those mistakes
but he teaches a lot of courses maybe he is overloaded
i aint gonna complain about my courses no more courses arent all that important for me anyways i am gonna sign off now have fun and take it easy with the report
good night hey any news on the report
ok
ok great
ya you better correct that
spinning beach ball
lol no i dont know that
i always had the standard cursor
my mac is so fast that it doesnt ever need that cursor
by the way did you ever get the correct states or figure out what the problem was hey so are you still working on this report or what cuz i made some formatting adjustments
i will send you a copy of the conclusion and disucussion
what was the problem with it
right i will consider putting those in for the discussion
but normally it is pretty stupid to discuss these trivial problems
ok you sent an attachment i completed the discussion and i helped with a bit of formatting
the rest is up to you sweet heart how is everything else going
ok
gotta prepare for the next lab so that i dont get chewed out by the ta
yo are you working on the ceg prelab this stuff is literally impossible for me
but you are gonna understand it right
i think i need your help studying for this do you wanna do that tomorrow after the seg lab
lol when do you finish then
you know what forget it i will try to figure out something on my own we can discuss on monday night
ya i know
but you always go through it perfectly it seems that is something i canât do
classes is what i got lol
i am free between 1130 to 1
ok letâs meet then
nay
i am going cuz i need help from the prof you should have came today he is talking about lab 4
yo groza just mentioned he has office hours from 12  1pm tomorrow at site if you want we can meet at site instead unless you feel confident about the prelab
ok i am still doing the prelab now we will see how much we know when we meet tomorrow
aint nothing we can do about it
oh hell naw lets focus then so we can do this faster i might be able to take over the lab tomorrow if you need time to study
hopefully
maybe they will help us with prelab in the first lab
i am getting a hang of the prelab now i just gotta read it over again to get the overall idea
very close of course i took breaks inbetween with some other stuffs but this is really intense
lol surprised to hear you say that
you seemed to hate this stuff and personally have little to no interest in this material i have
i am sure you do
this certainly is
good night
alright thats no problem i think i got the lab
hey how did you convert the swf files
ok thanks i am gonna look into it
hey whats going on
ya it is wednesday you havent been to class so you are paranoid
but i went to his office hour and his class and he confirmed in both
aint a problem think nothing of it and we dont got no lab tomrrow which is good cuz i got a lot of stuffs to finish this week
and i just spent 2 hours watching avenger lol
havenât been to her class so i wouldnât know
donât give a shit my motivation level is down there below the basement
excited to finish donât care about the grade
havent heard anythinga bout it yo do you have the note of the dijstras algorithm with you that we took on friday can you send me a photo of the first problem taht we did
ok
thanks a lot appreciate it
yup i just wanted the table and the diageam
i believe one of the last days
lol
well good luck
i am fortunate that my teammate reminded me the dates and i demanded to take the last
ok sure gotta remind me though
i will try my best to rememeber yo do you think people from different classes of csi2110 can form a group for a4
you can form a group and i was about to ask to form a group with you but i made a deal with somebody else
its cool dont worry about it
ya it certainly is it is very annoying i actually hope your partner gets cutoff from the project and penalized for it i really dislike people who dont take any responsibility for their work
where
yes
hey do you know the meaning of tasks belonging to the same group is it just every task in the house
didnât you finish your app though
oh i see
ya it certainly isnât
fills you with frustration that you have to carry a team of useless people this is why i told my team i am not doing that much anymore because that will get them motivated to do some work lol
did they do anything
lol ok i forgot to send you the documents for ceg
letâs check
lol yup
this is some bullshit right there
no no i can access it it is due tonight
well you know how the university is
wait wtf remember how we got the data onto my usb last time
the data is not on there yup
i can bike all the way down to school to send you the pics this is some real bullshit
i remember now so how are we gonna do this do we need those pictures if we need those pictures i will go down to uottawa right now retrieve them
it will take 20 minutes for me to get to school that is not a tough task you need to remake the lab3controller which in the lab took us nearly 3 hours so how about it
ya well it is a necessary task and i was the one who didnt check carefully anyways i will get your pictures in 30 minute talk later
i sent now
i will try to whip up a discussion
you sent an attachment here it is how is everything going
you just do what you gotta do i have done my part
its cool i got a decent exercise and i got some grocery on my way
and i also mistook that folder too at the time so it isnt entirely your fault i am gonna work on something else now you can take care of the rest right
alright later
hey are you studying for tomorrows quiz
u wot m8 you are not gonna write it or you are gonna just wing it
ok well the first part should be easy
the second part might not be it involves things like ptr nbr ctr
do you know what those are
i have the past quiz i can show you but the second part involves those things are you still not going to study
you sent an attachment
actually i overcomplicated the difficulty of the quiz
those things i mentioned like ptr or ctr are just names people gave to certain memory addresses but if you think about how we wrote the program for adding things then you will do fine
i have no idea
ya i dont go to them no more
yo whats up
i am curious about that as well the sample exam seems really short
i dont want to study for those basic chapters
well aint that the truth
yes most certainly i am excited to start in my coop place
i will realize how much smarter everybody else around me is lol
haha good time i think they take coop program pretty seroiusly and treat coop students pretty well so i am looking forward to that
what are you taking next semester any fun courses you are looking forward to
really damn
ok you too i am content just understanding the past exam and i will do a bit of review on some basic things and the lab
ya 2008 past exam mostly included things post chapter 4 as in including chapter 4
thats probably what i will do what i get is what i get aint no regret made
man thats gotta hurt
like damn thats what happens when nobody on your team works lol
i am really at a loss of words for what to say but except damn must feel really bad grouped up with some incompetent people out of your control
at least you are only losing 64 of your final grade which is honestly not that bbad
normally a project like this would worth like 20 of the final grade
i came out of that project less scratched than you with 60 but that is still the lowest i have ever gotten here in uottawa
its more like the people not the project
oh really
that is weird didnt they give you feedback
it depends on peoples computer it seems it crashed a lot for me when i ran my app but not for another one of my teammates but it crashed a lot for the ta
well hopefully things work out better for you you obviously dont deserve such a grade
well thats how school is it can make people feel incompetent about things that they are good at
man you are pissed
thats why you gotta get out of school as soon as you can
education is beyond saving at this moment there needs to be a major overhaul
you can get this type of group assignment tragedies everywhere i had friends who experienced this back in uoft
ya no problem i enjoy listening to people rant about stuffs because they are typically important issues anyways past exams have covered conversion between hexa deci and binary as well as mantissa and floating point stuffs
but they were like only one or two questions no problem have fun studying
yo did you checkout your final grade for ceg i cannot believe i got a in that class i thought for sure i would get like b to b and how was your winter break by the way
coop has been great so far i am doing some simple programming at the moment i think i will move onto more complicated things later on my break was good enough honesty i have been excited to start coop
i actually spent a lot of time working on my game
haha ya kins id kind of how was first week of school better than last semester hey do you know where is a good parking spot near tabaret
do you know if the parking lot behind on the church on cumberland is free maybe for a short period
this is not sacre coeur i am talking about i am talking about the church closer to rideau
i donât know the name of the church
you bet your ass i will
itâs a hangout for homeless
lol i am ok for today i had a fancy ass lunch paid by one of the senior developers today so i had enough food
probably wonât happen again for the rest of the term though
work is going great the person supervising my work believes i am doing good work so that is good enough for me i was never this productive while i was in school lol school is toxic i tell you
it is because i am making a video game now and the system is getting more complex so i find myself drawing uml diagrams lol
for not taking it easy on your project marking
he is probably just losing track of stuff which is still not quite good
well glad that turned out nicely for you
you got like a in that class
that is honestly good enough i aint gonna complain with that grade
well quite frankly i dont think they will find a job
i dont think they will do well on applications and interviews with that level of attitude and that is enough penalty in my book
wtf losing 1000 as in losing faith
ohhh ok what is necessary for merit scholarship again
85
ok well sometimes you jsut gotta deal with unfair situations you are gonna dwell on it for a while too which sucks
thats good
are you still only doing 4 courses
ya thats nice you are doing summer coop too right
i see and you keep working in your current company
nice
you wont have any debt by the time you come out of school
oh seriously
but like how much did your summer coop pay you
so you wont be doing any more summer jobs until you graduate thats why you are gonna still have debt i see
this year or next year
right damn you are on track
you arent that old are you
last time i thought you were like 278 are you turning 29 this year
lol how does that feel some people have already worked at google for 8 years by the time they turn 30
makes me feel like i didnt achieve much lol
do you have like pressure to marry or anything like that
well you hit gold
haha ok thats great for you
i sometimes wished my parents had gave birth to more kids so that they can rely on them to carry the family legacy and what not lol
wishes
i see it differently i dont mind working hard but i want to make sure that i live my life to the fullest which means that i want to have my own family
that is incredibly loving of you and kind
damnsorry to hear that
i guess it is hard in your position to not pursue your dream of caring for them
well those would be the orphans and the kids in bad families
if you dont give birth there aint no kids without love lol
i am on a 4 month now but i will do an 8 month either starting this summer or fall in japan already did all the interviews feedbacks from interviewers seem promising
either in kyoto or tokyo
i will be using machine learning and possibly virtual simulation techniques to do research on human cognition either honda research institute or advanced telecommunication research insitute
damn straight
after i come back i am gonna apply to google and all the big names
i am pretty sure i will get at least one of them lol two of them literally told me that i am their first choice and they are amongst my top 3 choices in the ranking
sorry to hear about your dog but i am sure heshe doesnt have any regret left in life
alright good night then yo are you in school during the summer
what classes do you have
i will see you in two of them i think 3104 is seg 3131 is csi i am presuming but i do not have anything that is 3140 i wish i had remembered stuffs from linear algebra ð¢
linear algebra is not meant to be used by most seg students after first year
but i am self teachign a bunch contents from deep learning and linear algebra is necessary
lol dont you need it for any of your courses
but did you actually need anything from linear algebra
how did you find the recovery
ya i think i am gonna have to rely on google as well already did
i didnt have classes yesterday
i had class this morning and another two coming right up today but probably going to drop the one i am attending now
it is a sociology course on technologys effect in the world
this course was my original plan for the elective this semester but i decided that taking a business course is more practical for my future
credit requirement engineering might be more strict on it than nonengineering programs
yes that is right it was not
what do you mean
including thsi one
well all i gotta say is good for you it is nice to graduate as fast as possible what is your plan after you finish
reasonable but i imagine it wouldnât be very hard for you to achieve that
there are a lot of good companies in downtown ottawa but they are quite competitive i imagine i wanted to go to tripadvisor but got rejected there are also portfolio shopify and kinaxia kinaxis
wanna practice with me ð you should go in the interview with the attitude of giving them the opportunity to hire an incredible employee
but do you wanna practice with me though ð° i can give you therapy to boost your selfconfidence ð
no i think i am fair interviewer i canât guarantee my technical knowledge is up to par to yours ð but i ask hard hitting questions my next work term will be from september till april 2019
yup
it sure is i canât wait i am self teaching deep learning for what i will do in japan you know i wasnt serious when i offered to give you therapy right ð
nah i ainât interested in that but i could be a motivational speaker in the future spouting the same bullshit as every other motivational speaker
i mostly say they are bullshit because the content of what they discuss are so simplified that they are rendered irrelevant what they say might be true but they are heavily dependent on a large number of other factors
september what is your lab section for 3131
well that is unfortunate i got mine on friday
i really wanted to work with you again ð­ð¢ð¤®ð°
nope we dont but damn i forgot about thatwe have class today we are supposed to follow monday schedule
the lab is not entirely useful to be honest
yo did you figure out assignment 2 question 2
i was hoping you did though you were my last hope
alright good luck with those i will check back on you in a few days please have it done
i know you will i could always count on you
lol i understand why you would want that i wish this guy can explain things better assignment 2 is actually very easy if it had properly explained the constraints of the problem
yaaa thats the course i was told with bad profs
are you talking about both database i and ii
well i am gonna take it for my interest
ya you are in a good position
is there no textbook for that course
lol
maybe the university is forcing that prof to teach
ya it sure as hell is the only reason why i am staying is because i have loans and grants from government if i drop out now i would have to pay back all of that immediately
i am sure there are still lots of things to look forward while in school you didnt go through osap
their grants are insane lol
lol that sucks
no i didnt i got some money for fall  winter back in last year
but i cancelled my winter term for coop so they took that into account and deducted
i dont know how that works i dont mind it though to be honest
this summer is got like 4000 grant from osap and 2000 loan
that is basically my entire tuition for this semester so like i am pretty grateful for that maybe it is higher for engineers who knows
whats a cap
oh ok ya i was supposed to receive like 8000 worth of grant for fall and winter but i cancelled my winter term so maybe the 4000 is to recompensate for that
ya cant wait goddamn
ya totally looking forward to it my friends and i are planning a trip for that time yo have you ever gone on a trip to europe before
france switz germany and possibly denmark how was london what did you do there
did you visit any naturalistic places
ok
did you go to clocktower
i see
yes i believe so
i started learning unity and have been trying to develop an educational video game since last year august i participated in a few entrepreneurship activities and took a course that further evolved my idea and by the end of the winter semester i had a prototype for a firstperson chemical laboratory simulation on unity
yo i know who you are
you participated in that 2min speech comp i was in it too i was taht gamification dude
ya same here i didnt know who you were until you mentioned what you were doing public speaking
dude sign me up man i am down i havent done much vr dev though but i think i can look it up real quick and get up to speed
ok so right now you cant pay me how much is the equity
whats the funding prospect looking like
i see when do you guys start work do you have everything planned out in terms of work for the next four months
ok that is good i want to work for people who already know what needs to be done they havent updated anything in more than four days lol so i am getting a little worried about their organization
i am in toronto now and i am not going back to ottawa during the summer so if we are gonna do that we need to do it by facetoface chat
sorry video chat yes skype is good
i am free right now will be free the rest of the week and mostly free during may i am gonna work full time starting in june but that is a simple 95 kind of thing
ya sure
i will get back go you in a bit so i can check my availability 6pm is fine my skype username is ftwdullsword
hey have you added me on skype yet
ok let me know when you add me i am gonna have dinner now
hey is there anyway for me to develop unity vr without a headset
no mine is iphone6 did you download anything for vr development on unity i went on here httpsdeveloperoculuscomdownloadsunity and downloaded the core utility package for unity 5
i then turned on vr development in unity setting but i get this error saying that it couldnt open vr in console every time i test it
maybe its because i dont ahve the headset
ok i have downloaded the vr samples on the asset store
this is the error message i get but this only happens when i am testing so i guess i shouldnt worry about this man it will be interesting to develop without testing capability
what do you need for a full setup just the headset
are you planning to deliver that headset to me the thing is i can try developing without testing
alright the earliest that i am going back to ottawa will be in july maybe i can develop without testing until then and when i get to ottawa i will pick it up from you
alright i am gonna get back to blender later
hey you mentioned we are gonna have a meeting today right
oh ya sure i can take that and when do you want to have the meeting
ya is this gonna be on skype or just a normal phone call i guess you dont have my phone
alright i am cool with that but we can call on skype i dont want to use my limited minutes on my mobile phone
ya
but i am almost always available online so skype is good
yes i did i am on my way of building it and testing it on my iphone i spent two days doing nothing unfortunately because of my sickness but hopefully i can get more stuffs done next week
you too buddy hey i just wanna give you an update on what i am up to lemme me know what you think about this plan
hey elad this is the unity project folder for the audio test i dont know if you will encounter the same problem since you are using an android so i didnt bother finding a solution to it
hey i actually wanted to ask you this question for a while now but i kept on forgetting i am doing my coop term from jan  april in software engineering
oh hell ya that is wicked lets talk more about this after you get that funding hope everything is going well on that side
thats awesome are you and the cofounder planning to bootstrap or will you guys get the salary after funding sorry if i sound rude asking this
i see tough being a founder
ya for sure i knew you guys are still figuring stuffs out so it wasnt a surprise for me that i havent heard back from you in a while running a business sure is tough haha
so what is up with you guys lately did you get any new devices
ya i am i will most likely be there in two weeks too to visit my girlfriend maybe later
ya for sure
hey nice to hear from you again i am more than happy to keep in touch with you once i get back to ottawa i will be back on september 2nd let me know when you are available i will be more available during the first week than subsequent weeks
right that is perfectly fine
absolutely i hope things go well for you guys it is a tough world out there
thanks
