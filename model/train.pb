joydeep sent a link why wouldnt you  even if you dont get the job you may who knows get an interview  thats still experience and plus you just made a connection
ah but i think its worth it dont apply to all at once apply to say 25 companies on one day and another some other time
thats what i did first year applied to a hundred or so companies you cant just apply to 30 and expect to get something with not much experience behind your belt
cool  would you want to apply to hackathons by any chance
no like the ones the unis in ontario have
like mcgill waterloo and the like
yeah theyre fun
yeah but thats how you build experience man
ive been to one loool my team didnt do shit but i made some connections
yeah my team didnt do much basically it was like a group project where i was left to do all the work oh cool which one
yeah you can work alone if but its eaiser if you work in a team
yeah and plus at larger institutions more companies attend
any it dosent matter which one you use really
wait like which hakacthon or which project
okay i was thinking western for the fall and maybe if waterloo has more for the fall then those as well
joydeep sent a link
yeah im doing that atm
not any yet since apps for most arent open yet i will apply for qhacks  delta hacks  hack western and maybe in winter apply to the international hackathons
hey did you take principles of physics i last year
oh ok this tas accent is too thick i cant understand anything man
lol i was actually about to go to site
she makes no sense no matter what shes talking about it feels like a younger version of the prof tbh
where in stite
site i gotta head to cssa ah well ye ill be on the 4th floor
which section of seg are you in  i switched
at lees right
ok which bus stop do you go to in order to get there  i dont want to be late
oh ok so you can take the 95 or 85 right are you here
do you have a group for the project
oh ok well i switched in and i dont have a team would you like to form a team
joydeep ó° when is the deadline to form a group

wow thats so descriptive btw i dont quite understand the prelab for ceg either
ok
yes
see ya thanks hey are you going to the check dgd today and the tech intern panel
79pm so all of eng economics

i forgot you can sign up on facebook
its a uotta hack event your resume makes me feel like shit
where is the google sheet page which has all the groups for seg
are you still trying to find a group for seg
i honestly dont know where my group member is or if hes still in that class
yeah ill try going to his office hey do you have access to the spreadsheet containing all of the group names in seg  do you
hey did you start the csi assignment
hey frank  how did you do on the csi midterm i didnt do as well as id hoped
bad
no
i didnt study enough for the midterm
i mean i didnt review that much before the midterm so i know why i got what i got but yeah im going to the profs office hours just to review and go over the problematic areas
im just going to do past midterm of course  trying to understand certain methods done in class like how theyre implemented  try to understand their run time and uh just doing the dgd problems
and im going to try to go to all the dgds for that class to tbh
i didnt go before because the ta was bad imo  yea thats true in general though frank do you have a study schedule that you follow  im asking you this because you have more experience
oh no i dont memorize things and i usually dont write many notes in class
you mean doing all practice problems
lol btw did you see assignement 4 for csi posted
well yeah
yeah i did
im gong tomorrow but i know what i fucked up on
the question about heaps or sorting the heap rather and then there was also a part of the last question about trees
yes i gave that in on tuesday ok you know ill look at my midterm tomorrow with the prof
yeah i mean i guess if i wasint worried about it  it would be a bad thing
i am i just procraintating like an idiot procrastinated
for me personally what ive found so far what helps is doing problems and reading slides either before or after the profs lecture just simply that
yea did you go to any of the dgds btw for algorithm algorithms
oh this week theres supposedly a quiz for that
lol how come if you dont mind me asking
did you get an email about the bus btw
i was debating on whether or not to go or study actually
im not sure if i should
like at this time hold on joydeep sent a photo ya idk

noo
dont spoil yourself thats your mission for the break then watch all 3
because its really good watch it  and youll see
o yo chill give it a chance
then why did you watch the clips
so looool do you always do this before watching most movies
sigh what kind of movies do you watch
its not a superhero movie superheros have powers batman dosent lol oh so you dont like marvel films either  like avengers
no  yes
lol thats tight man
yo
ohhh hell no nono ohhhh you are so wrong man batman what how did you not like his voice
honestly man i feel like one can only judge a movie after watching it  i remember seeing the trailer for planet of the apes and thought the movie would suck but when i watched it it exceeded my expectations
bruh yea
ah i watch at home
like nowadays i find dc movies suck im done with those meh i liked it
i hate those lol i only like kill bill volume 1
with lucy liu
did you watch inglourious bastards
i watched it the first time i liked it but watching it the second time  i didnt like it really
overeager action i find thats how most of his movies are
overexaggeration
yeah some acting choices are good like brad pitt
the movie that i do despise are michael bays films trash oh yeah hes really good
yeah he made transformers random explosions everywhere dont like the main character much either
gn i keep falling asleep in econ i want to get up and leave but im too lazy to get up ð
i did lol which assignement color do u have for econ
go on grades for econ find it
oh we arent the same then would goods purchased for resale be considered an asset right
hate this class man what are you guys doing in the game dev club rn
ah ok thanks for the info frank hey frank do you have a good understanding of design patterns  for seg
oh cause i was going over them rn he said we can have a cheat sheet for the final btw
lol yeah but still did you do 24 trees for data structures
hey frank did you go to csi today
lol oh ok i couldnt go today
i was gonna ask what we covered in class but nvm
why not  like csi or in general
ive noticed that she sorta mumbles in her lectures lol lol
we have an econ lecture on the weekend tt
idk man just feel like he might take attendance
uh he did when i went once
its bonus marks p
lol well ive heard it can increase by a whole letter grade from previous year students whove taken the class
joydeep ó° frank
joydeep sent an attachment this looks so damn goooood

did you already see it ah ok mb
true true well goodluck
hey did you study minimum spanning trees for csi
joydeep ó°
wanted to double check that we covered it got into a ubc hackathon not gonna go
fammm theyre not providing travel reimbursements
no
im pooor how much do bc plane tickets cost man
 ye naaaaaaaaw fam
ye naw then theres a bunch more hackathons
why what made it uncomfortable
well isint that a plane ride  xd
ye
same and treehacks
and the one at carelton gonna apply to mits too for feb did you do a5 for csi
ah when are you going to tomorrow
joydeep sent a link yoooooo shit dosent let me register ð¡
why the hell not did you start econ assignement i had a few questions
o ours are different
how far are you i have like 6 more q
will he take them out
like the options  oh
did u start studying for the econ final
what i dont like is that the formulas on his sheet are formatted strangely so i have to look them all up online
yeah its sorta confusing frank did you do the practice exam for econ  im doing the second one and i keep getting a diff value for one of them
whats an example of an activity in a state diagram
its on the slides activity is somethinf which happens when the system is in its current state
i get the definition but i just cant think of an example
joydeep ó° for the csi assigment did you consider the dummy nodes when balancing
yeah ok hey did you get to broker architecture or control flow diagrams in seg yet
how far are you on seg
you went through 4 and 5
are you asking me
ye as long as u know they key parts not too hard joydeep sent a photo please explain this architectural pattern when you get the time
ohhhh ok i get it a bit better now thanks frank
lol i understand what the observer pattern is in general joydeep sent a photo but can you explain this diagram for the pattern
how does that reduce the dependencies or interconnection between the two systems
yup one to many relationship
yes they would because they need to be notified of any changes of the observable
and by reducing dependencies you only get the things that you need data for tight right that would make sense
that too
makes sense
tyty happy early new year
joydeep ó° np frank did you get into mchacks  i got into hack brown lool morning btw
ahhh okok frank did you get your csi exammark back i didnt get anything yet
lol so where is your coop this term
oh cool i told you im finding one for the summer is it in ottawa
thought i told u before
prob theres a hackathon happening at the vatican in march pretty far
lol idk man seems interesting never heard of it before would you go for it
if they dont then nah
loool thats not why xd
lol does it seem like i hate all my classmates xd as in people from soft eng
dude yes i know what your talking about i only talk to a few people in our program and most of them just get really arrogant so usually i just keep to myself
yup are you still in that group chat
for soft eng lol i removed myself
lol i found it to be the opposite tbh ye i had it muted as well are you from ottawa btw
oh i didnt know which part of toronto
oh i want to switch out of se and go into cs
yes
the cs program is imo more flexible and can allow me to create my own pseudo coop streams plus with the courses ill be taking next semester ill be done 99 of the cs course requirements the rest of the courses will just be from the minor
it doesnt imo yeah it has mostly government placements
ive heard yeah are you going to apply outside the coop navigator ever
meh i never really cared tbh
i mean at the end of the day  its the skills and connections somewhat well hey if thats your niche then why not try game development next coop
which kind of platform do u wanna make games for
ohh so desktop not consoles huh
you play pokemon
i still like pokemon ye pokemon is better in gameplay frank u got my csi mark back i for the final exam
hackearth  never heard of it mind sharing a link do u mean uofthacks v
does it say accepted when u log in
log into your account
what does it say
oh then you gotta wait until 2nd round deductions desicions how do u know that many are registered or wait mine says submitted idk try emailing them ok i got in are you going to uoft hacks

joydeep ó°
its alright loool nice ciena right
o free do they have free food
o niice what technologies are you working w rn
ah so u just use java
oh ok
ya
loool idk man i just wanna learn as much as possible anything but government
ye lol how come youve read about it
nah
i only read things which im interested in
but ye when i have the time sure no thats not true
everybody will not hire u like that lol ohhh i see do u have a team
yeah those are everywhere
espically in our field oh damn
so u in it for the money huh so thats ur motivation
ð¤
loool i see
they use ml to build ai apparently what u want to do is i believe math heavy
so you know do your research on stuff
joydeep ó° ye thats good you have lots of time i find not a lot of ppl in our program are motivated to learn things they just do the bare minimum are not
yeah lol sucks but hey im glad your in se atleast your motivated lol
lol np xd a lot of people dont seem to wanna apply to things which are outside of canada lol
ye but that doesnt mean u shouldnt apply who knows you can get an interview
yeye oh lol did u think i meant travel
some
like the hack the north is the only big one in canada mhm httpswwwpalantircomgettinghired seems helpful for all interviews do you have a linkedin
do u know any good places to sleep on campus
second one i shouldve applied to uoft
thats fine i need a place until 6pm
in lectures
 i think ill just sleep at ieee office
nope
have fun you mind if u ask you a question
so like why did you choose to go here software engineering why didnt you somewhere where theres more opportunities like uoft or waterloo or ubc
ohhh i see okay why did you choose software or this field
ah okay you programmed a bit before you got into se
ohhh ok which courses do they program in atuoft at uoft
i mean the one that you took and yeah i think they teach i python first year
joydeep ó° uoft was so nice when i went for the hackathon holy
like as in holy shit lol
lol i thought i told you it was for uoft hacks v like idk a few days ago
nope this was at st george
i liked the campus it was so beautiful and yes i learned quite a bit from attending actually had a proper team this time
ye but at my first hackathon that was not the case lol
no it was just a hackathon at a diff uoft campus
hack the valley is the one that happens at utsc i believe uoft hacks v happens at the main campus
i think so
yes our hackathon was there lol idk imo it looked cool
lool nice bahan is the engineering one right lol
ohhh its so weird tho cuz of on the very last floor theres a bunch of mechanical engineering profs offices
yeah the other floors are tho it took me like 30min to walk to at george station man
nope took me 30 i had bags and stuff with me and im weak so took me longer
lol feel like i am like i had a backpack with me laptop and stuff and another bag with blankets and other stuff had to carry it all there
 leave me alone smh but ye the bus service is wah better in toronto man way
it is but theres just more buses available
yeah 100000x i hope i find a summer internship in the gta area
they have an office in toronto o
hey is ciena near the tech park in ottawa damn sounds cool
joydeep ó° joydeep ó° mb did u see apples building  so how was work
meh niced on that java grind yo accept my linkedin request man
you should use linkedin more
joydeep ó°
not yet planning to have one this summer lol frank for graduation date did you put 2020 or 2021
i thought its 2020 lol im confused
joydeep ó° how was work
aw riip
do mostly do mostly do testing good i got a call from a recruiter today no interview just talked about opportunities and asked about tech stack some stuff about company
not really she was in nyc she was a senior recruiter too so
we spoke about what its like working at the company general chat  pretty casual and she asked me what kind of opportunities im looking for
i told them that im looking for a software development summer internship
she said aiiight fam
i gotchu we shall definitely stay in touch
yee it was lol yeah i just emailed her afterwards wth a thanks and stuff
lol hopefully
lol actually they have an office here in kanata xd
their hq is in nyc but hey who knows
yeah honestly im just applying everywhere even ones not in canada
watch ill be wrestling gorillas by 4th year
uh idk lol uhh ig it could mean ill have more experience by then
lol thanks likewise fam alright night
frank what kind of laptop do u have whats ur room number too
let me ask he seems dead  hes tired  unfortunately
try pinging someone on slack
alright you guys just jumped right into ml
yup youre learning but i feel like you should take it one step at a time dont run before u can walk
also you dont need a hackathon do to projects you can do it on your own
joydeep ó° you have lots of time after work i want bubble tea man
how was hack the valley
nice do you know someone at ciena who i can talk to regarding internships
yes i am right now
ah for their ottawa and montreal offices right
oh i see yeah sure please do
joydeep ó° thanks
oh okay ill try to get in touch with her then thanks  frank are u busy today
nevermind wanted to know if u wanted to see black panther
rio rip
yeah lol already got tickets though for 630pm at gloucester
so idk you if youd be able to make it then
sure check if theres anything im taking the bus there
ok im here yes regular sorry for the late reply didnt have wifi on the bus  sorry man maybe we can watch something else next time
joydeep ó° are you into marvel movies tho
dont read reviews before watching movies imo yes yes i am mcu is really good
really good frank if youre interested in a game dev position checkout places in vancouver also check out playstationsony because they hire interns
yes yes they are im alright still applying to places and whatnot what about you
oh cool nice what are you working on
rn im mostly looking at places outside of canada because not many canadian companies are hiring students for the summer
ye
yeah certainly
but i dont mind going outside of canada nah just been applying one company in waterloo still had a spot so im gonna reach out to them
dont wanna do web dev thats why
something else lol
that dosent mean i like doing it p well i dont want front end is what i mean
lol so you need someone with a good eye for design
lol haha i get how you feel its not easy
yeah it is you just gotta keep going at it goodluck with developing your game
make it open source on github
cool well i mean maybe how many people contributed so far btw frank when you have the time mind looking over my resume please
ok imma send joydeep sent an attachment ok go ahead and roast
lol i appreciate the constructive criticism
really  before the job title was web application developer but i changed it to software dev a few min ago
since i felt it was too specific
idk man it could depending on the recruiter
nope i was an attendee however im sorta helping with organzizing this tech fair grace hopper  we are currently trying to get more funding to go so maybe i can put that down
yeah i think i should put that in place of that mcmaster engineering competition
alright
this is 10th version i swear lol like which ones should i just take out the interactive website completely
ah ill try but ok the awards section though is useless im taking it out
joydeep ó°
what about the load mechanism oh is the wording of it off
both skills are important lol
working with others is an important skill as a software engineer though or dev
you mean for that specific scenario
cause that would make more sense
for the mcmaster competition
alright
it just managed to hold a certain amount of weight thats all
yes the point i just mentioned was the main thing it did held a weight weighing x amounts for the longest amount of time as opposed to like the other 40 or so teams
sounds like a plan
ok and another question
lol i consider it to be tbh we won a scholarship or certificatethe scholarship we could only get if we went to mcmaster for eng or sci so yeah its basically a tech conference for women
ill put that in the won first placeand recieved xxx scholarshp ship
so im part of the grace hopper committee and i was responsible for this proposal which we had to submit to the eng faculty they give funding to students for clubs and stuff i came up with the budget
yes
i overthink things lol thanks for the help though
alright wait should i remove android app lol because my description just explains it ð¤
cool
yeah i agree there has to be more than planning and organzing budgets researching how much travel hotel  food costs hmm trying to think of more to add to the grace hopper thing
yeah i do
yeah thats true good point its hard to put into words lol just need 12 points then im done for this version of it planned and proposed budget in order to recieve funding to attend xyz conference
yay cool d joydeep sent a photo lol idk because i need a job thats why
it was a joke
i mean yeah im not really interested in hardware stuff but i need to make up an interesting reason yeah
wellits low level stuff so it will involve hardware  joydeep sent a photo ok this onei really dont know
lol its such a random question i mean 100 duck sized horses for me since the other option creeps me out frank redid resume again mind going over it  lol
joydeep sent an attachment there ya go
dosent fit i had to expand on work experience for now
what
yes i am trying to figure out how to make everything fir right now but look at the current content of it as it as it is
 how
oh you mean the role and location right
thats true alright
what do you mean
yeah it probably could
joydeep ó° sure
sure if i cannot find a job this summer i was wondering if i should take a few courses in the summer
that too udemy usually makes you pay though
no i dont like paying money would rather download courses from coursera
not if you download all their videos p
yo frank hows it going
joydeep ó° same ready to start your summer classes
wat really lol
oh yeah nice ah are you gonna use the coop navigator to find your next coop
well i mean even the shit they teach you in schoolis all online and you can learn on your own really
damn thats good
ah where if u dont mind me asking
thats still important to know
yeh
ayyyyy nice
consecutively
is it a research based position
ah nice
sounds like a interview on a different level which you had for that position
seems more research based thats why
its not the typical software engineering type of job no you should go in with an open mind
which of their location is it
yeah it still seems exciting so good for you nice
yeah thats awesome good for you man microsoft japan also hires interns so look into them too
opportunities are abundant everywhere you just have to be willing to look imo
ohhh my friend is doing that for the fall too
cj yeah maybe like ok
some uwaterlooo student went to microsofts japan office for their coop term and then microsoft japan started hiring from there lol ye it will be
yeah exactly  and no people just dont give a shit sometimes so they only end up doing the bare minimum yeah like hoenstly its crazy man theres so much going on outside of ottawa
i just hate it when people do the bareminimim minimum
obviously
yeah i know
yeah true well atleast you are atleast familiar with about what it is you have interest inc i still have no idea
nope i didnt see that what is that
oh okay
ah i see and what did wei say  i dont really pay attention to this stuff so
wait for his current coop term lol what did he say about his gpa
i agree with that
well i mean if you just had grades right and no type of other experience to show then hey man thats kind of on you right and i think wei swtiched out of software anyways so meh idk
let me see this lol
 jheez wei
yeahim reading it rn and yeah that was a dick move ive talked a few people in our program to know mos tof them are unfortunately like that lol but a few arent so
lol yes go for it  yo your paragraph sounds like your making a podcast loool
this is frank from software engineering
it does lol so sick lol i agree with the first half of your paragraph
i agree with that honestly it feels im not learning to learn but cramming info to just pass the class i like learning but ive always disliked school
yeah thats what ive read about too actually except for non profit companies lol
yeah well someones gotta change it b but i mean the primary goal of organizations is to make money tho
dosent sound easy to do once the organization becomes larger
i agree frank when u have the time look into harvards cs50 course  the prof is amazing
httpwwwdatasciencesocietyca12abouthtml
oh no lol its apparently some club we have
no clue tbh nope
i had a job last summer but it didnt really count as a coop term for me i had to take a course too so they cancelled my coop term but i job relating to software on my own
yeah sorry i cant help you with the work term report
how long does the have to be exactly
oh nice very detailed let me read it after your done lol i wanna know what you did at work too
i understand but still i like to read things  do ever read engineering blogs that companies have you can learn a bit from those too
theyre interesting so yeah sometimes almost every company has one lol like netflix
oh nice yeah lots of big companies do too look into smaller ones too like quora khan academy twitch khan academy is a non profit which is what u seemed to be into
ok my bad p thats what i meant to say about the company
hm i mean only read them if im walking outside or whenever im not too busy but idk i mean lots of companies do have open source which you can contribute to  but yeah if its some technology specific thing that only they use then ye porn wont have much use for it outside
yeah lol like on the bus or something and is ur company helping u with housing for ur next coop  it would make things easier for you
haha i get how you feel man then that means all u mostly gotta worry about is food
yeah going to japan seems really fun if i there i would also visit less touristy places too if i was going
loool japan is pretty safe p
yes and the 8 diff pokemon centers
yes always
probably
idk we might have it at home and im not home so idk if we do or dont yo frank
no nearby around 35min walk
5475 hydro varies depending on useage
ok thanks a bunch frank
youve read research papers before right
yeah one on machine learning i dont have experience reading these things so
haha yeah probably
yeah planning on doing that as well
yeah this could take me a year or maybe longer but im working on this with a prof so i could ask her some things too
ah ill read the first few intro paragraphs first
if i got an offer ill let you knowi had an interview last week im waiting to hear back from those guys atm
nope no clue where its from where is it from lol
ive head that name and didnt know you watched anime
lol i know i didnt know before
oh so mainly bio related  or is it bio and cs combined
ah i see yeah just do whatever interests you that reminds me theirs biotech companies out there lol maybe youd be interested in those too
hahaha that time will come but get experience first i would want to start own company one day too
joydeep ó° excited for honda
i always remember shit like this so yeah nice and you get to experience what its like working in a different country so thats awesome
lol yeah that would help
i dont want to be here i have one more left
yeah most likely
but if i cant find someone to sublet me place then im taking a few courses here yah
no that would waste money if i have nobody to sublet to
nah wait are you doing a coop for 8months  do they count that as 2 coops
this school has the stupidest coop rules and regulations
in uwaterloo that would be considered 1
if you get coop
what do you mean what thats if you even get a placement
yeah if you dont then its kind of pointless
its been 2 years and they keep pushing my coop terms back do you know how fucking annoying that is but regardless i still have to pay these fucking coop fees anyway when i didnt get shit
theyre making us pay during study terms
my brother gave me a call today and encouraged me to stay in software and ive told him why i didnt want to be in the program anymore id rather something in a technical related field like science or cs
no
no no it hasint yet not until like august the 31st
yeah i know man but its just im kinda scared because
internships just software internships in general man thats what worries me the most
yes it is
lol just what i mentioned
well its not easy cause see  my brother has been psuhing me to do software and it feels like quite a bit of pressure rightdont wanna let people down pushing
why it dosent matter
really  meh ive heard many times it dosent matter much lol
yeah
yeah basically
5 years down the road as long as i get a job in the software industry that i enjoy doing and where im learning  ill be happy
ok well why didnt you pick cs instead then
for doing what
and it sounds like your talking another having a peng
less than 2 of people working in industry bother to get one because its not required in our field
it depends on the individual
i have spoken to a few software and cs graduates already theres no difference man it depends on you always dosent matter if its software or cs nobody gives a shit  but yeah you do you
joydeep ó° nice frank i feel like im kinda overthinking things tbh  after my final tomorrow i think for a day or two i should relax a bit and just calm down i think
did you experience something similar before
i mean nobody is pressuring me my brother just wants the best for me and i get it right but when i mentioned to him the reasons as to why i was kinda getting irritated by the fact he mentioned that ok i understand where youre coming from but in the long term he thinks its a better to pursue software
who as in what does he study or what do you mean
hes studying mechanical engineering at uoft masters
and hes 26
he worked at ford beginning his masters
ah i never thought about that frank idk if youre free next week but if you are do mind we can talk about this stuff
yeah i will
maybe to calm down i should watch avengers or something i guess or science lol
oh well its just general science bsc
i told before like a few minutes ago either comp sci or just general science  i dont want to keep on extending the amount of time during which i finish a bachelors degree in software by either having to take courses and miss a coop term
joydeep ó°
ok see you then
regardless though i dont think it will matter too much at the endi always overthink things lol
yeah thats quite difficult to do
yeah but the senior in highschool didnt realize that because i was stupid lol looking back now it was something so trivial to worry about
yeah im slowly starting to realize these things tbh
frank it honestly seems like the end of the world at times to tell you the truth
yeah hopefully im just going to probably chill for a bit tomorrow after my exam is done at 1230  thanks for the advice
yeah for sure and im only 19so i dont think my life completely over yetso yeah
slowly getting there are you done your work term report btw
lol not a lot do they usually just start the day or two before
ah makes sense play something big like a coop report takes a lot of time to do lol plus
well you gotta watch all the movies that came before it
maybe at 4 wait on tuesday i might have to meet with a prof so idk how long that will take
nah thats fine
i probably wont have time on tuesday next week to meet
yeah can you send me your resume in word format please im trying to make my resume in msft word
ok thanks

oh okay sure also  are you planning to do only 3 coop terms btw  we only need 3 to graduate
yeah its true we only need 35 coop terms to graduate
nope youre fine as long as you get that minimum but you know i think you should let the coop office know that oh i plan on only doing 3 just in case
alright
ah ok coming
is our class on the 4th floor
joydeep ó°
lol too lazy to move
excited for class
lol this course seems kinda useful so are u in business management the course
yeah thats it wanna be in a group for this project
cool
oh ok cool i wish steve rogers had more lines in the movie
lool same
i can understand where hes coming from though btw you gotta watch guardians of the galaxy
loll but when caps crew entered tho that was badass
fate  is that an anime
ahhh yeah i stopped watching anime so i wouldnt know im a bit stuck on part 4 for the lab let me know how you did it
not now when you get there frank ive decided if i make the next facebook or microsoft then im dropping out b
true true what do you have in mind
like jarvis  b alright tony
lol i wanted o build that as well yo frank this can be your capstone project lol
or u can start on it while youre in japan
ah true true if i was there id go to all the pokemon centers
no lol as in actual pokemon centers
yeeeeee yo pls go send me pics  i wanna go so badly
yay i wonder if you get a work uniform
yeah i wouldnt either i wear track pants to most my interviews anyways or hoodies
lol im cheap as hell so i dont bother buying formal clothing unless i really need to frank im not wasting a suit unless its an interview at a bank or somewhere like bloomberg
wait what graduate school or a graduate course  i thought he was in software lol
looool interesting curious why does he look on down on softies
yeah the ring dosent do jack shit lol ahh
ohh okay makes sense i mean i do agree with the fact that a few software engineering students not all see themselves as more superior in a senseand ya not everyone cares about the ring like me lol
ah
austin ben and idk about this other kid i forgot his name short asian kid
i cant remember lol  and this one hi haneen uhh yeah i guess so mac or something
and yeah probably a few others who ive seen and overhead but idk their names lol ya hijab
thats what he said but yesterday hes like oh i want a ring and i want to be called an engineer or some shit like that
they just think theyre better than everyone else they feel to entitled
one time i remember ben was talking about how the ta or prof dosent know much about programming and he sent a screenshot of his conversation with a ta and he was just calling the ta stupid and whatnot for getting big oh notation wrong or something like that
and lee i just dont like loool hes weird
mac or lee whatever this short asian kid with a high gpa in se since im not the group chat anymore idk how to tell you who he is
ya ya him lol wait what kind of accomplishments
what did he make
lol i remember once i was talking to austin in class about whether or not hes applying outside of the navigator for coop jobs
oh yeah that kid brags a lot about his gpa like he thinks getting a b is a low markand complains when he gets a b
yeah whatever man i mean hoenstly i talk a few people here and there
like i try to be nice lol but usually i just do my own shit who knows i like people who i usually talk so im going to continue talking to them
ah yeah he switched
lool
yeah i guess so lol when was this
omg my friend told me about some kid in her soft eng class who tried to do that xd yeah
yeah youre right
cool well goodluck on whatever youre working on man
is for school
damn ok have fun yo
if you know anyone who has no partner for ui mind telling me i need a partner for that class
yeah and the assignment thing
ah i see also any song recommendations
lol what i listen to music when i work

not taking that class frank  sorry
ah okay thats good how effective was training at ubc for japan
what  scared how
wow damn from what youre telling me it dosent seem like the trainer knew what they were talking about
ohh i see did this training cost you anything  like paying for the course
aw damn
tired man i came back from walking to loblaws oh okay then thats good
when i feel stressed out then yes i do
yeah sometimes walking sorta helps anyways so wanna start the first assignment for ui sometime this weekend or next week
sure joydeep ó° do u know of any good asian places to eat in ottawa
ive heard of it it sounds japanese tho
oh my bad i meant korean
ah how was santosei ramen
better than toronto ð¤
idunno frank i kinda just want food but idk im trying to look for something cheap man im just hungry
is it good or thai express
ah fine with me or might just end up getting bubble tea xd
i wanna try a flavor ive never tried before any recommendations
lol i didnt know that you dont drink it ð
sure i gotchu fam
httpsyoutubekdmiz6pgqpe this guy is pretty talented they were pretty accurate
ya this bbt was so crap man barely any sugar it was matcha red bean
nope so it sucked
nah theyre usually pretty good do you know anyone go dosent have a lab partner for ui
ah okay cool beans also you dont watch star wars do u
oh i heard last jedi was garbage lol
yeah me neither but i thought ill see how crap it is
is that a thriller kind of movie  nah frank ive heard this star wars was crap
ahhh i see spiderman with andrew garfield also sucked so did most of the transformers movies
lol ya i guess this new star wars villanova looks like a lightbulb villan
his head looks like a lightbulb
not yet when is your seg3125 lab
ok we are in the same lab yeah idk what kind of website to do
fine with me yo frank which ml course did you take
udemy courses
im gonna try udacity and coursera cool
lol gaming ey ð¤ i got no errors in android studio finally that thing is hella slow man
joydeep ó°
yeah yo for the lab  cant both the summary and welcome screens be combined  like it dosent have to be 2 seperate screens
thats so pointless
so essentially then the first screen is a calculator
yeah i get it now the calculator part will be annoying like positioning the buttons and all
i forgot about the business textbook until u mentioned it lol yeah it was in seg2015 a bit
how much is it though i think my friend got it from the school bookstore thats the last place id go to
id do the same thing amazon that bitch
lool sorry its a habit
highschool i guess and i mostly grew up around my brother so i caught onto his mannerisms
yeah lolll
haha
yeah well i mean my parents were at work most of the time so i was around that kid
who knows
ð¤
lol yeah i do with my brother especially over the phone
i never you knew you used such harsh language man ye
ok nah not like that lol loll
nah when u have the time today would you mind sending me the powerpoint for the lab  from seg2105 pls im getting formatting issuesthis why i am not a fan of front end
thanks a bunch homie
shiiiet dawg
its so fun tho bruh
looll ok ill stop i wonder if im the most ghetto person in software i mean our year
lol i do
thats why i think i might be
ye boi
yeye yo is android studio running slow on your laptop
oh i thought u were doing the lab
ah ok then chill out for a bit ive been doing android for hours do u have any idea of what ur project will be for seg
i kinda went to bed late because i was doing work is this meeting until noon
yeah im not going to todays class since im busy at noon
is there anything else i missed i feel like a dick for missing my meeting
this okay
yeah so for seg3125 when do u wanna meet up
friday seems better  and we still need a second person still talking to a few people  actually i have an idea frank ill tell u after i finish eating
its normal lol so my friend is the vp of the software engineering student assosiation we still need 1 more person or the evaluation it would be a faster approach than me having to contact each person individually
cool beans
waiting for tolu to rely back cause hes at work ok when do you wanna meet on friday
which time specifically
ok ill let bijan know
alright got someone
yeye oh frank we gotta decide on a meeting place do you think we should book a room

yeah hate it when that happens
she was at a meeting ok just finished the call lol she was cool
i mostly asked her questions specific to where she worked before lol fb khan academy medium and also complained about school so that was nice

deal on cookies frank cookie
d
thats a sad life ohh true joydeep sent an attachment
not yet  im looking at steam myself after i eat my breakfast im using steam rn
and having trouble with sorting games by review quality lol i cant think of any malfunction which would make the system fail
i was thinking man if we cant think of  then we might as well pick another software system  think of malfunctions the website does what its supposed to do
yep looking for a few rn because the malfunctions are a pretty big part of the mark what do you think
the project  you mean the chore application
oh is it  ive never used it before can i be the test subject lol
joydeep ó° ive found a few shitty websites too
ok sure
yeah
well the software didnt fail me in any way right a malfunction is something which causes the software to fail
like ok the ui is pretty trash imo because its too consistent lol idk if that counts ye
oh okay then
also the sorting thing was hard to do from observing both the canidates ah lol
also when searching its kinda hard to narrow down results until you get to where you want to be like theres no simple dropdown below the search nav bar which is what most websites have
well i cant find it
no not suggestions i meant search criteria it only shows that after youve searched something
yeah ill try to think of more wait the pdf says just a list of malfunctions
ok so we do a discussion of the 4 most significant malfunctions that were found and we also list the malfunctions
ohh i misinterpreted it before
very true ok im already getting started on it
ok frank san
what
wat
vr
is this a side project idea
ohhh i see so thats what you will use unity for also when you said that the opening page has tons of ads what is so bad about that
how
ahhhh i see what you mean  good point
yes that such a good quote to describe it haha hows toronto man
lolll nice where did u guys go to eat
nope
damn i gotta go there how does one enjoy school or try to
is it really tho well rip
and then forget everything afterwards d
well yeah for most profs ive met 2 who actually do care
liam peyton and my old digital systems prof
previous director of software engineering i didnt i spoke to him he teaches capstone design frank question
ok i think ive asked before but i forgot who from your previous coop deals with coopstudent applications
ok thanks whats that persons email
ok thanks
frank
i need funding to attend a computing conference in september
so most scholarships are closed and i couldnt find many i was thinking of asking profs but idk how much theyd give
the applications for scholarships are closed msft ghc
not sure how else to gather funding besides asking profs
yeah im gonna try as many outlets as possible lol i really wanna go man
lemme send a link its called the grave hopper conference grace
httpsghcanitaborg2017sponsorshipscorporatesponsors ohh okay have fun fam which part of the android lab are you on
i still feel like i dont fully understand android while doing this lab
i dont have that material it dosent help much imo i mostly just googled things i need
practice
ok i will work on that after i work on some of my android lab today hey so apparently steam dosent seem to save your birthday when accessing mature rated games i didnt try this but bijan told me
frank i gotta talk about 4 significant malfunctions which ocurred during videotaping do you have the video file on you
sure go ahead look it over and see which ones we can use lol
yeah i will it doesnt work using the converter
let me just download it and see if it works that way
it should work that way once its done downloading
lol i am not video work works
joydeep ó°
ok frank san also do you have the video with bijan as the subject
yeah ohh because i needed more malfunctions lol i need 3 more
the other one i think of kinda smallits just the ui consistency from the video w chelsea ok also what did chelsea mean by the search suggestions didnt go away
ohhh i see ok thanks for clearing that up
oh ok tyty also how was your interview with honda did they ask anything technical related
ohh okay
ohh i see alright seemed like a pretty chill interview did you interview at other places too
were any technical
ohh okay were the rest from the japan coop program as well
ah nice
i have a technical interview thats why i thought you might be able to offer some advice
lol you dont memorize algorithms xd cmon fam its on friday its for a software developer position in ottawa
but why memorize it and my brain dosent work well if i memorize things
no i have to understand things i just dont learn well through memorization i cant remember things if i memorize them
yeah there is not anyways hows your software project for ui coming along
joydeep sent an attachment i thought that the article would get sent separately my bad ohh okay
no but it was in this group
ladies storm hackathons on fb
yeah thats so random man
lol idunno man i mean if you wanna flirt then theres tinder  oh yeah tinder hires software interns lol
lol competitive market hmm you make it sound like job hunting
hm true i guess it could prob depend on the person too
damn
im just focused on school and software and shit yo hahah goodluck frank san
not all
what what
i meant some ppl dont care about the types of jobs they get  theyre ok with any job
yeah i meant ppl around us  when i said software i meant software jobs yeah doing a coop in japan would be cool microsoft and google have an office there
what girl i mean i can try lol
hmmm
it depends on the girl and yeah no youre right i think it was because she was prob caught off guard a bit since linkedin is used for making professional connections and whatnot
neither did i i guess she was prob weirded out by calling her cute
neither do i fam neither do i
i didnt even know it was lol
haha no its fine dw about it am i an introvert or am i neutral
ah
lool what thats the first time ive heard that ohhh yeah since highschool i felt like i have a much eaiser time talking to people
ye fosho are we still meeting for business tmrw at 10am
oh wait what i thought it was weekly
alright peace out idunno if it is i dont wanna go i prob just study for the interview
lecture  we have a lecture
joydeep ó°
lol are u gonna go
damn thats early fuck these outlets
nvm it works now lol this kind of shit is what i pay 5k for bruh
uni is a scam man
wait yeah lol do we need to record their facial expression lol omg
yeah i wrote it down i mean like on video
i thought you did as you were using your webcam to record it
well they didnt say anywhere on the assignment that it is nesscary to record their facial expressionsis writing notes not enough for them ill ask the prof
ill ask just in case i mean idk how the ta will mark so
lol os i heard is useful tho
and qa seems kinda useful too qa
business is pretty fun lol ohh i see
in qa
ohh fuck are the labs atleast useful
tcases what are those  like test cases
ah i see
ill have to look up what that is ohh it sounds kinda outdated
theyre poor they cant afford nice software they spent all our turion money on making that new engineering building i went to the prof and hes like its fine
ok but i feel like the first one was kinda valid interesting  or do you mean to say significant
the first malfunction where the user has trouble sorting the games by review quality
reaching the search page is not straightforward
ok then that is the first malfunction i wrote
yeah the second one ill replace
ill do the second one above mature games and ok about should college be free
why is that
i never said i wanted it to be free
do you want to give in the assignment on wednesday or should i
joydeep ó° we are on chapter 5 in class btw
no this is for ui let me finish eating and send you the notes for business
joydeep sent an attachment there you go hopefully it works and lol dw about it joydeep sent an attachment
watch it lol
sure
joydeep ó° class participation counts for marks for business rip
about 5 sorry its 10
well today we finished chapter 5
not yet haha for the android lab when you go to a new activity  how did you save the data from the previous activity
yeah thats what came up when i searched
no
check brightspace the prof said we have no class
nope uh sure
yeah sure when will you be at crx
okay so today or tomorrow  lol
yo chill lol all im going to do is work today xd
joydeep ó° so you dont have a fan at your place
you should buy one
are you cheap or something
ah where in crx are you
ah ok ill be over there in a bit which floor is it homie
joydeep ó° im here
in hell
the left side
joydeep ó°
youre not in any specific room
ha nice
what is the room number
joydeep sent an attachment is your app constrained layout or relative layout
when i added the rating bar  the view kinda mseed up
 git rekt git good welp back at school
joydeep ó° kill me im never using the avd again
i was thinking of getting another one when u run the avd on your computer is it slow yooo dawg i got the rating and shit to show up on the popup menu
tyty my ui skills are lacking do you have your settings on a completely different activity
might need your help with shared preferences
are u there rn
ok ill check it out ok so it worked when i used my back button on my phone and then chelsea changed something in the android manifest file and it began to work
legit it is yeee thats my boi like its hella slow so basically there was no need for shared preferences at all
joydeep ó° we arent just meeting over discord  what
ok then who the hell said i need to come to the meeting room
oh
joydeep ó° wanna start assignment 2 today to yo
oh so you wanna do this after class
joydeep ó° let me eat some food and i will see to you there
at the very last room farthest to the left you mean
i am at the far end like the farthest from the left i dont see you anywhere tho
httpwwwarngrennet this can be our backup website lol
nice bike ð where do you want to be in 25 years fam
hahaha nice powerful waifu ðð you guys will be a power couple i strongly agree with the last point
is the main goal
i dont know mine ðð
lol well for now its just getting as much experience as i can within the dofferent inudstries in software like 25 years from now i am not sure
i is home i is i am not going to grad school
i am not going back to eating noodles each week again lol yeh
i joke i have other food
fried noodles maggi
sign me up fam
lets go
joydeep ó° my plan as in what my goal is tomorrow or what i will be doing tomorrow
ill let you know i was planning on doing the project for seg w chelsea
alright
alright so why finish the eaiesy things first  so more time is left to do the more difficult tasks
yeye whats the 4th rule
how do you stay motivated
i am but i meant how do you constantly stay motivated because sometimes there are those days where i just dont feel like doing anything
like i get tired
meh
i dont have an inspiration i just have short term goals lol
yeah short breaks help try to find work at a place that i would hopefully enjoy doing its kinda hard to know right now what exactly i want to do because i am not 100 sure
23 interviews just been emailing places
everywhere tbh i just use a google spreadsheet and also google a few places too oh the companies were both small businesses one in ottawa and the other was in toronto
this week
i know what is the difference between controlling
sorry i meant what is the difference between leading and controlling in terms of management
okok so is controlling kinda like telling peoplw what to do like more forcefully and can leading be thought of as guiding people in the right direction
ah and controlling happens at the end i see
yeee i saw that lol why dont you work there
aw shiet you wanna work on the research side  yeah google has offices at so many different places compared to fb i do find facebooks main product kinda boring ð
joydeep ó° ok so apparently i cant add any courses for some reason
alright joydeep ó°
yo
ok so then we arent doing that website
alright im going to try to look for a few then httpwwwlazorofficecomhome
ye i did find one xd so far
yeeyeee
ok so when i clicked on one picture
of a project it said that the project is still in development but it wasint until i clicked on it that i knewso it kinda wasted my time lol
i dont know if that would violate efficiency of use because that was not efficient on my end lol yeah architecture also interests me as well
ah that makes more sense thank you also if youre into arch check out arup that company made the sydney opera house they work on some pretty cool shit
that is true frank san
ye
ahhh
i have another one too when i click on a project all it shows is pictures which is fine but no description of any kind whatsoever of the project like how it was constructed or what materials were used etc
like for some projects it didnt have that
httpwwwlazorofficecomhomecyclops i mean like for this one why the hell did you even use those materials
so that would be a heurestic eval regarding error then for your bug
mhmm
thats true i dont see any help page i mean unless that is supposed to be the contact part of the website usually websites have a dedicated page just for help
yeah i mean its not even there so ok it seems like we are okay with doing this website
lol yo im done adding stuff to the assignment for now you can add whatever else you find to it
joydeep ó° yo dawg
any good movie or show recommendations
is it good ð see what i did there
awww shiet any movies
watched wolf of wall street lol
i hated that pulp fiction
lol ouch
i was joking fam chill i feel like you talk less like them as opposed to me tho
wat
oh i did not see that lol
yeeee
movie series hmm ill look into it
i wanted to watch one peice too
ohh its one of those
ik its long but ive heard its good lol what about hunter x hunter
ohhh what about soul eater
like i only know the mainstream animes ahhh
ohhh shit i forgot fullmetal alchemist shiiiiet
i only watched the 1st episode of that
joydeep ó° have fun
so do you not have to take that circuits course dude did you already take circuits
ok how or where did you get the numerical value assosiates with each heuristic and im not talking about the severity rating nvm
for the second lab for ui do we only use html
oh okay im kinda tired of building websites
thanks man
i know also i watched the first ep of fullmetal yesterday some good shit
2000
lool why correct
so the one made in 2000 is darker
oh dang
ah yo did you ever play ac ii or any ac game
play that shit its good
lol i do idunno where you heard that
why dont you play and find out i dont play on pc
whenever u get the timedef play it do you have any consoles
i cant remember last time i played its been like 2 years nowadays its mostly pokemon lol
months getting back on this shit in aug
yooo get a 3ds if you dont already have one

ive heard of it did you ever use autocad
im also interested in building 3d models of supercars and buildings
not right now
because thats not a priority
no its not
jobs school
this isint that important so why go all in
ok even if i do try it what value does it add because its not related to software engineering directly
dont grades kinda help in landing some jobs like finance
apparently they dont
well my friends whove applied and gotten interviews said they dont and google asks for transcripts to confirm whether your a returning student i mean theres lots of factors
i mean i get what youre trying to say but i feel like focusing too much on one thing isint always good lol i think having a balance is better
ok
thats not false what things everything
wait hold on why social life thats last on my list lol
nothing is man the people who i mostly talk are nearing graduation they wont be here
i dont talk to many people from our program in our year yeah it does make things more fun
like i dunno man i feel like i have nothing in common w these people
so the 1st rule should be go super saiyan in all aspects of your life
something about my phone  lol yeah man its hard to find people to relate to peng was that one person and now he left he was exactly what i strive to be
popular  i dont like them
i do yeah but ben is arrogant
i talk to austin sometimes and tyler
yeah thats true ive tried messaging ben once though
asking about some company but he didnt reply back lol peng says i need to be more open minded
cause i said that i tend to gravitate towards people who share common goals and interests and hes like well that shit is hard to find everywhere then he said yo fam be more open minded
yeah me too i do have a few friends outside of eng but we dont communicate frequently tho
errday thats my boi
oh naaaw i dont do that shit
yeh yo frank wanna apply to be a msft student partner
like i mean apps are due at the end of this month lemme send you the link httpsmsdnmicrosoftcomencamicrosoftstudentpartnersaspx
connections possibly is my guess
from what peng told me he didnt do much ð lol wait what
its an msft student application to be a student partner theres a link on that page lol its up to you man
how unlikely rip
ah
peace
you mean youre part
frank i liked learning about android finally i know one thing im interested in
lol tip calculator lab
lol morning
joydeep ó°
i hated it and yeah i know i added severity ratings im just going to go over it again and see if i can make things sound better
it kinda was
planning to rewrite it and why are you asking about physics if you dont have to take it
sure
unfortunately not today
when do you plan to do the interview
ok i can do tomorrow
ok ok fixed let me know if i should reword something
alright joydeep ó° how long is your interview
ok
no i dont wanna
and i dunno where you got that from fam i aint creative
ye i used to draw
chill i dont wanna do ui or ux as a career that doesnt mean that ill stop being creative
joydeep sent a photo idunno if your interested
yeah i dont get these kinda emails often yee go talk your homies
ye your homies from japan
looool yo capstone idea ððð
whats that

im interested in vr man but not porn
ah what are the lessons tho ð¤
ohhh is this even any fun
ah lemme know when u make your ui cheat sheet
do you have a ps4
brruuuuh
forreal use that coop  find deals
like
i thought u were gonna say vr porn lol
oh do u mean with your friends like a grad trip lol it was a joke chill my friend switched out of software eng to biomed mech with an option in computing thats a handful to say lol
nope it actually is
i dont think you know her arbina
ye lol what nothing
idunno tbh its not clear to me
why does it matter
i mean its their desicion
i never thought of it like that
joydeep ó° httpswwwvoxcomworld201861217452616trumpkimjongunnorthkoreasummit
sickk he emailed you
ye ma boi hes super chill
ye yo
do you have the material from ceg2136 i will be taking that next semester
can u share it please
i wont thanks frank san
ye just got it on drive
joydeep ó° i have no food frank wanna help me with a scholarship app pls
joydeep ó° are you going to the business lecture today
joydeep ó° so for the project my part depends on amars part so should i do a part of what hes responsible for do i just not do shit until he starts  im really confused
joydeep ó° httpswwwthevergecom201861317458506smashbrosultimatesnakebuttnintendosamuse3 should you let mentions get in the way of things whwn making desicions
lol idk emotions my bad
ah positive change
hm
no frank i want over 9000 books
ð
is it really does it depend on the situation at hand
ohh so wait if you arent taking circuit they are you also exempt from mechanics too theory
oh undergrad
ahh and youve probably taken linear algebra im assuming
so u barely have any bs courses then so lucky
theres also embedded system or some shit like that in 4th year
i think it has some hardware crap thrown in from what my friend told me the labs are hella long
probs do you not like hardware
why is that
lol not many software eng students do
ahhh your future company right  or other plans
changing the education system lol true you know im surprised that our school has no architecture program uwaterloo recently added some new program called architectural engineering
i dont understand the difference bw that and normal architecture program carelton does
what do u mean by art form
lol oh no
the program at carelton
httpsadmissionscarletoncaprogramsarchitecturalstudies there u go
oooh why
i heard that too i still dont know why lol how is it better tho like uwaterloo kicks everyones ass when it comes to eng uoft i mean it has the brand same with ubc engineering
ye
but i mean does it really matter where u go lol at the end of the day  i feel like it all depends on the individual
when you said what  that u wanna go to carelton
dude chill its fine i was like that for all of first year
lol night the globe and mail nvidia is the latest foreign technology giant to open an ai lab in toronto httpswwwtheglobeandmailcombusinesstechnologyarticlenvidiaisthelatestforeigntechnologygianttoopenanailabin
yeye
lol wanna apply for jobs there
you can still try to get in touch with ppl who work there
dosent hurt tho still to ask btw frank wtf is 4chan
nah can you explain what the matrix organizational structure is  with an example
oh its both functional and divisional apprenlty apparently did we talk about geographic organizational structure
how do you find the business class do you enjoy it
and youre disappointed
i hate that class lol
i shouldve taken a more hands on elective its kinda boring
did u begin doing lab 2
i hate it shiet that well atleast its not supposed to be fully functional ð
joydeep sent a photo done for today yo i swear im so sick of doing of websites after this lab no more yo
idunno if i should go to the wedding this weekend shit is going on with coop which is kinda stressing me out
no no  its regarding changing my course sequence
because the coop lady said oh if you dont do the fall coop then you may not be able to stay in software engineering even though my gpa not below a 500
im not trying to find one for the fall im trying to change my coop sequence so that i have a coop term in the winter
courses theres some which i gotta take
so instead i should be following the 201718 course sequence because certain courses are only offered once a year behind
yeah i emailed the director and he said definitely talk to the enf office first then go to coop engineering well i will be one semester behind
like i would have to stay one semester but that is not too big of a deal in the grand scheme of things
and with this sequence i get one extra coop term  which is nice lol
more experience is better you dont have to
i want to because to me that is valuable
i see your point fam but way before you even start a company you need build a shitton of experience and expertise to yo
cnbc elon musk sends company email about extensive and damaging sabotage by employee httpswwwcnbccom20180618elonmuskemailemployeeconductedextensiveanddamagingsabotagehtml cnbc elon musk sends company email about extensive and damaging sabotage by employee httpswwwcnbccom20180618elonmuskemailemployeeconductedextensiveanddamagingsabotagehtml
tesla employees get overworked quite often apparently elon seems like an ok guy except for the fact that he wrecked an uninsured mclaren worth around 20 million joydeep sent a photo also i love the ui for this app
dont be frank
thats all you need to be yeah  yo frank nobody is a god lets chill for a sec
ð¤ i have one its not celebrity tho
hahaha its not you ðð
guess
i thought it was obvious lol ye
did you meet him
aww no when was this
the first time i met him he asked me how do u build facebook i forgot the answer p ahh how tho
he sometimes dosent notice people when he walks i have a habit of doing that too it depends
you can make it more difficult by adding constraints ig
then talk to him
i dont think he gives a shit lol just talk hes in palo alto
so idunno when hell be back
 yo imma ask
ye wait how long ago
idunno ive seen ppl walking around for weeks it could still be going on i think
o really
aww
he graduate months ago went to staet work in march
wait do you mean he came back for someone elses graduation  what you can only put the ring if have certain years of experience in the industry you have
neither do i lol
maybe ð¤ cause he got his ring in dec want to cali in march
ah bruh i stilll gotta buy tickets lol uh
what  how
about  discrete math
oh nice well im glad you got that course our of the way man nice
did you just email some about it
yee nice im so jelly from the faculty
true true but still tho youre lucky that you dont have to take the physics courses  the labs are a pain in the ass
yea man like nigga physics i really
i thought it was the engineering board that makes us take this shit
ohhh ok fuck them both then
ah
lol still deciding p i gotta see how much work i can do today fam
tyty
lol i have no problems
its just i wanna leave time to do some schoolwork too thats about all im worried about atm
i is homie i is is is interesting btw os
noice do you need to know computer architecture well to understand os
joydeep ó° peace yo
why did u have to take discrete math in first year if you already took the other one at uoft
ahhh ok
ahh ye theres lots of bs  i dont like the engineering administration theyre too slow at getting shit done
how so was the one at uoft higher in difficulty
runtimes
come up in interviews sometimes
idunno where u see proofs
any
software interviews are very very different from whats taught in class oh
for data structures
theres lots of ways something can fuck up ig
yooooo thats hardcore
i was joking lol
ah nice what do u think about the profs here as compared to uoft like for cs and soft eng
well i mean the ones at uoft are at the top of their respective fields arent they lol
same with schools like mit and the like i guess does it matter though because you still gotta self study everything regardless
ahh the quality of profs makes sense in that regard then  i heard that cs at certain schools is more difficult  though also it would be nice to have enthusiastic profs teach courses
yeah for sure the soft eng profs are alright i mean when they read off of slides just why man like my databases prof seemed like he didnt wanna be there at all
oh i already took it warning tho profs for that class usually arent that great it was very disorganized when i took it
its okay frank thats why online courses exist  oh alsoo i shouldve done this look at stanfords database lectures theyre awesome
joydeep sent a link
i know man  but they didnt explain shit so well so i mostly just went to my tas or what you can do is just self teach but maybe relate that stuff to your projects
why not continue to pursue both  if its what you enjoy doing than keep doing it and get better
and you dont want to
yeah same here you can do both but one at a time hoenstly tho i feel like school dosent feel like learning at this point its just study enough to get certain marks
yep
lets make a swot chart analyze this shit
nothing i was joking xd how is it a political problem
yeyeeeee what is uni even meant to teach you because we essentially just learn everything on our own
ah yeah youre right
lol most people just wanna get the hell out and stop giving a shit
ah so an organization thats more centered to bring in students into the workforce  ð¤ yas cheap tutition pls
or do you mean building a more applied skillset yeah and profs some profs
unis just hire profs baaed on research not how well they can teach this education shit is all bullshit yes i agree  but for professional programs like law and med we would still require unis
engineering i think in this case would def work for the institution that youre describing it kinda reminds me of capstone but instead of doing a 2 semester long project it will be for an x amount of years
yeah because just get so burnt out from school they really have to be passionate about what theyre doing would the course requirements be the same frank it could be interesting to work on this for capstone actually
lol idunno about ui the point about mentality is so true man how much time do you spend on school related things outside of class
and that includes shit like doing practice problems blah blah blah i dont either lol well i mean i do cause i need this degreebut i also kinda dont
yeah exactly cant meet people that way talk to you later joydeep sent a photo loll dkm man ð old farts zucc so ive talked to upper year software engineers and they said gpa dosent matter too much
ye just here for that you know peice of paper joydeep ó°

no none frank do you think its worth taking an online course during a coop term getting that shit out of the way
ð¤ i mean is there any point
i didnt say i wanted to but i was just thinking about it fuck it could be doing something more fun during that time
meh have fun yo
im making a rough draft of my part for the business project and it sounds bad when i write i have trouble making stuff sound good
i mean it dosent feel well put together or flow well
im not sure how to write the introductory paragraph well
its not on the shared doc but its recommendations i didnt put it on the shared document yet then i was gonna transition into implementing the solutions so the other paragraph am i on the right track
ah ok so for mine i have to pick the best solutions and give reasons as to why its better than xyz
joydeep ó° hows your side project
yeah lol we can do that
ahh when is it
you have quite some time then
yo u got business done fam lol tournament
nice i was watching ac origins walkthrough
assasins creed
yeee you should play it
joydeep ó° which chapter are we on
hmm ok ive been waiting at the engineering office for 15min  i had an appointment at 2pm
like kill someone like dude how slow can you be
i just did shell be with you shortly
got our
joydeep ó° hows studying for os
ah accept your invite on github
meaning  will we use github
seperate branches
yeah exactly  also frank can you try to figure out how to place a space between home and used  the text looks kinda strange
sure np
the lab or project
no i didnt
joydeep ó°
yup exactly its a ui class so basically its just a mockup of the actual thing so no need to worry about backend goodluck for ur os midterm
joydeep ó° reach discord yo joydeep sent a link somw useful stuff some
yee gotchu i got asked systems design in an interview plus its fun lol i heard ur os prof is shit
if i remeber i think our ui prof is too remember correctly
for what full time
oh i dunno well i had this is os prof for one class he was pretty bad fadi malek is a g
wait fadi or ur shit os prof ye idunno bruh
ok which lecture is he on for ui
joydeep ó° ty are u going to business or are u just staying home and studying for os
desperate lol
ah thats good you gonna ace this shiet
from who tho
oh ok
joydeep ó° yo we show the website next tuesday right
alright well we still gotta do the pricing page for the website the checkout form and shit
also the website is not supposed to be fully functional right its just the mockup
cause my friend presented the lab to the ta today and he was saying a bunch of shit like its supposed to be functional and all that fuck
no like he meabt the search and shit is supped to work supposed
we arent supposed to focus on backend lol this is a uiclass
he was from what my friend told me he seemed kinda unreasonable shes emailing the prof about it
sure sounds like a plan im gonna try to add descriptions of the books today
uh maybe the end of this week
i was hoping to get this shit out of the way joydeep ó° universities have too much bureaucratic bullshit
thats prob the main reason why i hate it courses i can atleast have control over bureaucratic bs i have little to no control over
ahh sick sick how was it
nice still not bad
ignore what i just sent on another gc msg  also what products interest you the most at fb its for this fb scholarship
why
lol in india
ya alright i think i got it thanks anyways
you learn it when u start one imo
wait what do u mean by the second point looooool dkm i feel like in this industry people steal lots of shit from others
yo no pls dont goooo
ohh you mean the winklevoss twins
back at the harvard days yo tyler and cameron winklevoss httpsyoutubeap2uwsjv25w this will be your life frank yo ubc has an 80k scholarship for cs thats crazy
wait the guy in the youtube video  what kid man honestly scholarships feel like scams nowadays also can you read my paragraph for adm1100 unformatted report and tell me if it should even be there
i dont understand any of the cons for the third alternative ð i dont understand what they mean
ohh makes sense so theyre kinda being over transparent
too transparent are you trying to say that the product cannot be shit
a href is a link oh great  we also gotta make a payment checkout page where the user can enter their credit card info and stuff
are you gonna make it back to ottawa in time for the lab next week
joydeep ó° hows toronto
fixed formatting issue the dropdown menu dosent work im gonna try to see if theres a problem with the bootstrap
oh okay thats fine apparently my friend emailed the prof about this lab and he said its supposed to be functional  but in the lab it says otherwise which is confusing
neither do i lol the lab says one thing but hes saying another so if the ta asks then we can just be like these were the lab instructions
im gonna try to work on the shopping cart and payment forms do you mind working on the search
alright i was thinking of maybe when the user searches a specific book  then you can just link it to the button lol
yes the search button so when user searches for something and clicks that button the button is linked to the page for a specific book
thats what my idea was ill try to find sources so u can go off those for now i am trying to do business
as for how you were talking about damage control and users i mean companies cant please everyone out there wouldnt there always be users who have some form of mistrust lol
like we can influence users but we cant control them i think nah its all good
ah yet true true joydeep sent an attachment i really like listening to this guys interviews
joydeep ó°
yeah also repositioning the book description
im not working on that atm i am studying for my midterm
i will do it as soon as i am done this chapter its not a course you guys are taking
useless bs easy but useless
oooh happy canada day p i might get bbt later shit its gonna close
sure
oh you mean the descriptions not yet no like description wiae
wait how can we lost marks for not having items centered in the nav bar  i thought the design aspect was up to us
idc as long as the functionality is there thats what the ta checks for
yeah just for the navbar at the top it was from the bootstrap website
sookw the dont design for the descriptions has to be the same as for the menu bar
i got the font from google fonts let me send u the link once i am done eating actually its in the header yeah thats what my main focus is
when searching for books
yeah so just remove it im trying to figure out how the hell to do form validation
yeah the dropdown was being weird for categories
i never wanna do website shit again
no i just dont like doing anything related to websites
oh nice should i make a checkout form where the user manually enters the book they want lol
joydeep ó°
no why whats up
oh i see what you mean so do you want to use the current nav bar
i dont really care tbh as long as we use the same one throughout ok sounds good the checkout page looks decent now now for the validation part
yeah basically like theres supposed to be an option from there which says proceed to checkout right now im just doing the checkout part
checkoutformhtml
underscore after checkout
i dont see any file with that name anywhere on my branch nor on github ok so if you want my checkout page which im still modifying then ill have to merge my branch to master
nope i made a new html and css file
already did just gotta merge
joydeep ó°
yes i just merged the shit i did on my development branch
idunno cause i did git merge mybranchname when i was on master
sure i just switched to my dev branch and it said nothing to commit  working tree clean wait did u do git push when u were on master
like after you used the git merge command oh i just did merge and that was it  i think that could be why
it should be on the master branch sure
wouldnt that conflict with both of our changes joydeep sent a photo also i was thinking of removing the review order thingy what do you think
ok cool also from where you currently live is the commute manageable
oh no i meant from you live in ottawa  to school
also theres a thunderstorm warning so be careful ohh
yeah ottawa weather is trash joydeep sent a photo what
is it was evwrybody is freaking me out man idunno i have a midterm tomorrow ill deal with business later
just the error messages with the form idunno how much ill be able to finish by tonight though
trying to get the error messages done
good point maybe i should calm down ð
well atleast i got an a on the first lab lol i am neverdoing web dev again lol yo you didnt change the main page right like bookwebsitehtml
ohh ok then im gonna remove old one then sound good
i did and i didnt know made another version of it lol so i added the previous one back
bookwevsitehtml
it was the old homepage except it wasint centered ya
well i push back shit on master cant so ill see what happens can you check the master branch one last time and see if the website works ok so i got the category thing on my branch
tried that it wouldnt let me pull either
on my way joydeep sent an attachment joydeep sent an attachment required datavaluemissingâthis field is requiredâ joydeep sent an attachment httpscodepeniomightytejapenovbqqd might be useful yooooo wassup dawg
lol which one
damn why does everyone who ive come across play either that or league whats so special about those games
they are what yo i wonder if it would be possible to do an exchange term at another uni that would be interesting
joydeep sent a link why dont we have this
maybe d our school has teams but i dont hear much about them except robotics
they have lots of other teams too and it takes lots and lots of finding funding and the eef dosent give much funding to teams
chatbot of what kind
why is that
that sounds cool what about unanswered questions
err whats the difference bw a theory and a model  kinda confused searched it onlinestill confused
oh ok also for the seg phase 2 wtf do u do w operational definitions
ohh so u wanna save the world become the next iron man ð
no be better be frank fam
oh you should watch iron man
2008  did u have a lease on ur current place or was it month by month
oh ok im trying to find something thats month by month in ottawa but most are either 12 or 8 months
you live in quebec dont you i said im trying to find a place in ottawa man
no i just dont know where my coop will be in the winter better not to take risks be getting an 812 month lease httpswwwimmoderecompathganphp this website is trash
nobody would wanna buy shit from this guy
fine
task list android app
nothing its basic functionalities how was os
 you passed through right i am so scared for that course man
i heard the prof expects you guys to know material that wasint taught in class
ohh okay
no in the summer semester i am not happy w what im hearing about the prof  its not offered in the fall
ah it just seems like so much content and it looks like everything overlaps
idunno if thats the right word to use but what i meant was concepts that u initially learn are seen in later chapters
ah ben is a pretty cool guy
yeah yeah you were right also got grace hopper tickets
end of september hopefullysept 25th we just have to wait on the faculty for their side of the funding
ive asked amar about it and said that we as getting 4k
i know we are still finishing it anyways im just glad we got tickets registration closed in a few min and tickets got sold out quickly
well it is a highly sought out conference lots of employees employers like everyone  and anyone u can think of is there
ye fosho i will get you contacts from there dw
are you sure man this is a good opportunity
lol you come back at the end of next winter right
tell me your specialties and interests besides ai and ml or unless thats it
so ed tech got it i should still apply for external scholarships for grace hopper right yoooi this is ur question boi whats education gonna look like good job
lol wait is he a part time prof
ah did u see google duplex
joydeep sent an attachment thought youd find this interesting this reminds me of fullmetal alchemist kinda lol
yeah i both my grandfatherd died my mom dad died years before i was born i mean what would be the point of cloning a wolly mammoth anyway
yeah
hmm i mean having it around now would be cool but could it even survive
ð± what did the prof say when u showed him the game
and
what a showoff loll
yeah
i will once im done eating joydeep ó°
ok its loading
so why does the cube change color
oh ok everything looks good one suggestion that i do have is for the graphical results try to make the text more visible
in my room the lightbulb went out and kinda hard to see that text lol
ohh thats true joydeep ó° good job now go make a company lol
edtech and science huh
ye while in japan woowoot so is ur position there mostly research or engineering based
oooo
i want to try to read papers as well why is it sad i thought thats what you do at a research job no
activities like
ah
httpsopenaicom check these guys out
lol
loool omg
i thought you were gonna bring up elon musk ð
ofc you do there was a 15 year old who interned at openai who made a paper something in ml with a prof at berkley
rip
not true i say well besides the age lol
ya that lol
now hes going to mit
lol i was trying to read the research paper got confused on the first page
not just that but man theres so much background knowledge before even trying to understand whats going on
yeah exactly
online
ah i see yeah google has shitton of stuff google is breaking into every industry honestly
haha hm or make a company and get acquired by them
everything is up their alley man
hmm
probably
ah they should but i dont think its their primary concern khan academy would and coursera would be those companies
khan academy i feel is not nearly enough for college level education and higher and thats where coursera comes in but theyre not free
i dont think they have college or graduate level topics man they are good for learning basics so whats it like doing research
research kinda seems lonely lol
dont you do work alone
oh true
ah i heard research tends to move much slower than academia we didnt have any ui lecture today did we
ok so my friend wants to do a phd and masters but she keeps saying its hands on i mean i thought it was mostly theory
she wants to do it in biomedical engineering
what
honestly imo not really xd uh theres blues fest or something going on tho not sure how long it lasts for
riip then i have no clue tbh fam what is it that you want to do
same
im out for a walk right it is and i was tired of reading shit
let me know a time and a place
uhhh moviesmuseumi dunno anything else lol
i dont watch horror films lol did u watch ant man
yeeeee its hilarious i think i might get back on the drawing game
nah i havent
noooo its horror lol i wont be able to sleep
lol oh okay ant man and the wasp
well that movie just came out recently so it might be full quick you can do either tbh yo tickets are cursory on tuesday tho cheaper
naah nah go on tinder dates lol find yourself a waifu ok when do you wanna go tomorrow frank but you gotta watch ant man 1 first
ah up to you you sure
nice ok u can watch ant man online like anywhere make sure its good quality
lol what how xd i dont like watching good movies shit quality tho or you can download and watch it even better i say
yo whats going on
yo you gotta learn this shit on your own
also which theatre do u wanna watch ant man and wasp
thats all of them
ah okay ok so for os just look at other schools slides other lectures lol does the prof use someone elses slides
httpwwwsiteuottawacamgarz042csi3131lectures use his slides
or that too lemme know how that udacity course is i was gonna look at it later
yoooo sick glad you liked it  do we have presentations in the ui lecture tmrw
joydeep ó° goodluck yooo you still down for ant man tmrw
like are u still ok with going today
i just woke up i dont see any regular tickets available though
joydeep sent a link i only see vip or some other ones yeah i only found regular ones at the nepean theatre
i guess so its okay ant man and wasp wont be out of theatres anytime soon anyway
we still didnt get any damn email from the faculty regarding out finding our nor did anyone else nice
yeah harass who i dont see jack shit in their website and ive already talked to amar he said we ppl should expect to hear back last week
about that i dont know if i will have time next week  i have an exam that week
lol finals tho gotta pass man lol i agree with you well i have it on the 26th
the one that u have business
gimme a time and a place fam
always like 247

did he say anything about it
yeah i was there when he said that but no cheat sheet
cause he didnt mention that
that wouldnt make sense why have one for the midterm and none for the final
i dont memorize things
i cant memorize shit if i try to memorize things i have a hard time remembering things
i mean for something like seg courses for multiple choice questions i feel like you can be asked for such a specific question how would you know what to memorize fot something so specific
lol ya man you gotta know the essence of things according to your os prof you on campus rn crx
floor and room number  yo 5th floor
left end  joydeep ó° yoo do the echo 360 shit for marks its easy

i thought uoft profs were world class lol
i mean never heard anything bad about profs there ohh really
ah yeah a few are
i thought that was every university
yeah man yeah and why does this school bother hiring part time profs some are goodjust curious to know tho

what for which semester man you look for jobs 4 months before or even way before that when is your next coop term
i see you can start looking next summer or near the end of your coop for now you can make a list of companies that youre interested in and dont just apply to companies in toronto
ohh wait so are you planning on working full time next summer
well then if thats the case then start looking now so you arent taking any courses next summer
oh ok so this has no effect on your graduation date
oh ok well i mean your getting more experience so id say its worth it then
so yeah if your finding something for next summer start doing research right now
yeye applying for jobs is a full time job man prep for technical interviews too
and study up on data structures and obviously know all the shit on your resume to the t which time do you want to chill on friday
alright
dude it varies from person to person theres no definitive answer to that question stop asking questions and just apply everywhere lol
what are you working towards
ok well i still cant give you an answer to that question lol you just keep applying until you get an offer how do you apply for jobs
not just application pages emailing them messaging poeple on linkedin applying through indeed linkedin and engineer jobs
yeah besides applying on their site ofc i just had an interview now i was fucking eating man theyre asking to come in person but im booked this week
yeah lol so random right
httpswwwaversancom this shit and i suggested why not do an online interview but the hiring manager prefers it in person
both lol
ye
i dont know did they anyways they should atleast be more accommodating do you think i should go if i have other shit booked  like its so sudden too
i dont feel like cancelling any plans like tomorrow me and friends are going for kbbq i dont see them much since i go to school 5 hours away
i would like to do that lol but i dont know how to phrase it
loll did you start applying to places
lol already why its ok to take breaks
you have to keep doing it yeah it does  its difficult man i didnt say it was going to be easy
depends on how badly you want it please dont be like leo
ill tell u on friday didnt i send you a list of companies on google sheets
ok whats your email
ok sent
yeah some some are weird and dont have proper emails regarding careers or jobs
you can add or modify it as you please

oh also have 3 references on hand too and have your official transcript ready as well

ah yo joydeep sent a photo is this accurate
loll brampton tho is very true joydeep sent a photo llolll check out this job at unity technologies httpswwwlinkedincomjobsview899246183
yeah i know lol and i didnt know they even had an office in montreal
they have an office in finland talked to one of the engineers from there you like gaming edtech and ml
ð²
right but what specifically are you interested in learning about  oh btw i meant industry wise not role wise
ok then go into ml research if u want money yeah i feel like theres not many edtech companies out there
ok joydeep ó°
for finding my winter coop  nope
you can apply outside and use the coop navigator i have never used it so far and maybe not
yeah i have
yes
phreesia
they made their interviews harder your looking for the summer right
maybe there is jobs for the summer dont open until the winter semester
yes thats true or over the phone unless they are in japan
8 months are you learning the math behind ml
woohoo
joydeep ó°
very boring trying to learn ml
trying to learn the mathematics first
idk what the right approach to learning it is though
i know some probability concepts i need to learn stars and linear from calculus i remember everything from calc i but i may have to go over things from calc ii
i thought that in order to understand most things in ml you gotta have a solid understanding of the basics right so for now im gonna begin learning stats and linear algebra and also
do i need to learn deep learning before learning ml i know thats a subfield of ml yes
whats the difference between the 2
oh lol is there anyone else you know learning ml
loll
i think along the way im gonna take some notes down to remember things
oh idunno at the government
hm idunno lol
you said that our heard she is which means that she didnt tell you that she is you heard it from someone else
then say that she told you lol
what in ml is she doing
ah which division of the government is it is it research or engineering
ye i will hows your work so far
ahh thats research right
alright hope you are having fun in japan tho outside of work
do u still use tinder lol
ah
try different approaches
nice man keep practicing night httpsblogopenaicomopenaifellowsinterns2019 apply here
nope i have not ok which positions did u apply for
just go over data structure and algorithms and yeah maybe go over concepts like oop and if you have java and python listed on ur resume then go over questions regarding those too does that help
this is epically important for google
haha well they can ask u any question just practice a shit ton so u can adapt to what they ask you no for google there are more questions like that in the interview process
review it and do other types of problems like that in increasing difficulty httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdx981cuufmfeatureshare
yep
idk how this counts as dark humor
nope
yes and i just emailed phreesia and i talked to the recruiter joydeep sent a photo joydeep sent a photo look how cute that is
cold email
no contact page of company site if they dont they maybe message someone on linkedin from that company and ask them
sometimes
whats ur number  im going for a walk and i wont have wifi
no i mean i can text you ah gl
httpsshannonlabsco
dude whatsup the weather in toronto is shit

oh japanese curry no im in toronto lol i was at north york a few min ago for thai food
well theres snow plus rain for hours now hard to drive and see the window

ohhh full stack ah dude ur car is old af
rapyuta robotics

ok but keep applying no its another company
you keep applying until you get offers

yeee for sure i dont like ottawa much
nah i dont like the location in general
haha no clue man i dont care about politics tbh
ah well i dont understand that shit well
lol in what politics
im really not tbh
in terms of what mentally speaking ye
uh thats not the right way lol i mean its a bad way to approach things
ye sorry i was watching a netflix show earlier with my brother and i couldnt reply
i dont know whats up man
ouu noice dude ive seen peoples profiles on linkedin who are ml engineers and a shit ton of them have either a masters or phd
yeah tell recruiters that lol ugh
do tell
yeah since its not widely covered in undergrad
right and the math ofc
yeah
i mean if in undergrad we dont really get this covered would it also suffice to do undergrad research in ml besides self teaching
yeah ofc my brothers prof mentioned that sometimes doing something like a phd can limit your job opportunities too
oh makes sense what else do u enjoy learning about besides ml
so basically aimldeep learning then
joydeep ó°
well maybe other shit too lol so do u plan to do more research oriented coops btw
i talked to deepmind at their booth and they hire interns year around
they began hiring undergrad interns too ouuu sick did u apply mostly to jobs in canada
apply everywhere outside of canada too
apply to 100 noo your gonna miss out on opportunities
bruh pls but up to you so ig u wanna stay in canada after graduating
ayyyy thats the spirit lol joydeep sent a gif from disney gif yo

yeah but os material kinda seems interesting i hope i dont get the same prof i prob will
ohh rip have you had any interviews recently
ah i see well interview at more places and see how many offers you can get thats good to hear
ah yeah it takes time man i got rejected so many times without even a coding challenge ð did u apply to japanese startups
ah theres prob lots more ik that shopify will have internship openings around the beginning of winter semester i think
yeah
huh you can use any language you want nobody cares unless its a language specific position
ah you have to make lots of assumptions i think too i didnt give myself enough time to complete the challenge
yeah i gotta practice mode
more my bad lol
in terms of
applying for jobs well too late for gpa
ok for me i can do that for coops or jobs but in terms of school i uh i kinda just want a job right afterwards so for school i kinda just pass and do the best i can
well yeah i just want to pass
no its the new tomb raider yeah why do you bother putting so much effort in school if you arent planning to do another degree afterwards
just aim at getting good ive talked to a bunch ofcompanies at grace hopper and even ones that did have gpa requirements still talked to me and took my resume
shit like which school you go to and gpa are just resume padders nice to haves but i dont think they are a good indication of a good software engineer depends httpshaliteio

lol it hurts from falling ice but i think if i practice more then ill get the hang of it eventually
 hows japan
lol its hard to tell through text message ouuu sick
sick well im gonna hit the bed good luck with your hackathon
lol i gotta wake up early tomorrow
well yeah
night joydeep sent a photo remind me to apply to this pls
i wont i rarely check my email nowadays and i have other shit to do so i will forget
uh dont think illget in actually fuck it not spending money on a ticket
i knew it lol well good luck
idk what that is
ive seen those questions for the conference lol
arr you just going to meet girl girls
how big is your place in hk japan lol
lol my bad i was thinking about hong kong and you still didnt answer my question
 just say it big enough
sure whats up
nothing studying hard getting them killer grades are you in coop
honestly chilling i flew through first year with a 100
i had already taken all the mandatory classes so i was taking easy intro classes to my program
i was signed up for coop but i was in electrical in first year i didnt have coop till year 2 i had zero side projects and i was very involved in everything i did
not in my field i was an instructor for the university
the university runs a kids program in the summer for science and engineering i was an instructor
thats what my first summer second summer i was on coop i worked for the federal government as an application developer for the bankruptcy filing system
so much honestly most first years arent as disciplined as you or i this is our second degree
most first years slack skip class party dont understand how to study its their first time away from home and they are abusing the freedom especially in software 2nd undergrad i meant p
in software classes arent hard you can skip and still do okay and because software has mandatory coop most software kids dont care about grades most software kids in first year and second year have a gpa of 56
so when we have a 8910 yea we stand out we are the commodity
we are what the employers want
i have 11 interviews this past semester and was offered 5 jobs upfront and 10 jobs total most students do 20ish interviews in software and if they are lucky they get 1 offer some people dont even get placed
so as long as you do well dont have a stick up your ass and dont act like you are better than others this ones a big problem in software youll do great career wise
directly from coop
for software jobs yes like 250 jobs i usually apply to all the ones i like and after i get 10 or so interviews i cancel the rest
nope i dont want to work for a big company i dont need tons of money i dont need glory i just want to do shit i like
ruby easy choice far better skill plus its not hard and you could probably learn it all in the time you have left
i do im about to head to the store but when i get back ill send you everything i have are you using a mac pc or linux
for ruby on rails youll want to use mac if you have it you can use windows but man is it a fucking bitch to install mac is simple
ive got some good stuff youll like from a uottaea graduate
wont have that problem i assure you
not yet
im waiting in line atm let me see if i cant find it this is his website httpwwwcaseylicomtutorails
httpsdocsgooglecompresentationd1yexrwimxw6zn3lk8q0k3hvfovplay0zqssezghfddyeditslideidp this is what i liked there really is no good tutorial for windows installation but this is good for mac httprailsinstallerorgen thats a good installation
good luck its pretty simple and ruby on rails is all over the web you can find tutorials and examples easy
have you ever done web dev
good web dev uses a mvc structure doing mvc from scratch is kind of a pain in the ass and easy to fuck up ruby on rails lets you do all the work with one command really easy
it sets it all up its really neet it also builds anything you want it to need a database done need permissions and rules for users done need xyz done
really cool shit the idea with mvc is you dont want to hard code anything everything is generate generated based on the user its how we can both go on a website and its adapted to our user settings
exactly
no the deadline for profs to submit grades is january 9th all grades should be viewable by that time i already have 4 of mine
oh yea
nope im not big on showcasing my work however i have plenty of friends that have you can show off anything you want totally worth it a bunch of sponsors will be there
thats not a bad plan
true that
anything they want its your 5 minutes someone did a presentation on the history of emoji last yeat year
yep and thats totally cool but you got 5 minutes
nope 1 we have 30 minutes for all students dont be greedy
5 ideally not many people apply
either or is good ubisoft will be there so many the first is better
sure where you at
want to talk about democamp tomorrow than
you do trust mw i have faith in you
and its going to be fucking awesome i know they did because that email comes to me
well talk tomorrow alright
trust me when i say you will be amazing i have faith in you
send me the new slides
you did great frank
lots
dont worry about it p most people here arent gamers
excellent ill get you in touch you around during the summer
beautiful ill try and set up a meeting asap evenings okay
jonathan sent a link
thought of you right away when i saw it
right im right there with you on that subject
i know the feeling all too well
i never had an apartment on campus p
i did rent from someone subletting there were no photos
they are all the same and honestly it doesnt matter what they look like when its on campus haha
oh yes many times
alright
yeo
yep
do you want to create the data frame and then insert the data or do you want to do it all in one step
cool simplest way is as follows d  dataframealpha13 beta46 gamma79 d    alpha beta gamma  1     1    4     7  2     2    5     8  3     3    6     9
gotcha so not the simplest
what format is your data in
all 400000 are in a list
df  dataframematrixunlistlist name ncol bycoltstringsasfactorsfalse try that change out the list name and
cant promise itll work
but your answer is going to be in that type of format
what it does is it creates a matrix of  ncolnumber of columns and automatically fills the matrix bycolby column and transforms it into a dataframe or its by row df  dataframematrixunlistlist name ncol byrowtstringsasfactorsfalse that one its byrow
yea so your data will be entered by row untill all columns are full and move to the next row
dr  rbindbasketsdf cyour data
the second
gotcha c will concatenate the information you put in there into a row then you can bind it to a matrix
dr  is the name of your data frame so if you used the above your data frame is called df
hmmm give me a sec try df  rbinddf cdata make sure the that data is in the following format cdata1 data2
equal to the same amount of columns
nice i totally still got it b b
whats it for
google man its your best friend and dont be afraid to tell them that
awesome
a true computer scientist at heart  you dont learn r in software just in compsci modeling data is really important in compsci
i think the choice is clear
fuck the ring if you lost the ring do you know how much it cost to replace it
take a wild guess
the engineering pride and joy the symbol on engineering integrity what would that cost to replace
let me tell you
it cost less than 20 to replace its a cheap piece of iron nothing more there is no more significance from it than a piece of paper with i will hold integrity the ring doesnt mean shit
no joke
lucia has a kind heart but i cant say the same about some of her colleagues the compsci and software kids spend the first 2 years of their degrees together in the same classes anyways
not really haha i just have a distaste for kids with superiority complexes and a disrespectful attitude waterloo software engineers are the worst uottawa software kids arent far behind p
lol i know they arent all bad their are a bunch of humble really nice waterloo kids but they all have this mindset that makes them think they are better than others because they go to waterloo
but the pride and superiority complex that comes with going there is real there are coops at ibm dont wont even talk to me because i go at uottawa and because im in compsci its real haha
before i answer that please indulge me with these other reasons
ha see i never had a biased towards waterloo kids till ibm  didnt have it at cusec either but once i came back from cusec i did meet all of them and they dont talk to any uottawacarleton student
i asked why and the answer i got from one of the guys was their is no value in having you as a connection hahaha there is i died
ah man best answer ever
yea i asked one of the guys privately and that was his answer i wasnt impressed
yep smart guy ill give him that but smug motherfucker
it was rude and uncalled for on the first day they tell you that their is no one better than anyone else that we are all equal and that we can all help eachother i laughed
of course
exactly and its only the guys haha the waterloo girls are fucking chill
lol just be kind and be yourself youre a passionate lad you have way more to offer in my honest opinion
enjoy
any time
oh man congrats glad i could help
im one of the convention organizers haha so yea ill be going p
both
haha i guess we never talked about it p we just discussed games yea i like anime
difficult question but i suppose if i had to pick just one code geass
pretty much haha
i like political stuff i heard ive met the voice actor for it a half dozen times or so cool guy
yes yes the english va
nope
havent seen them
heard of them though
i like the style
garden of sinners
ask away
sorry im at the convention i organized and got really busy getting things ready and my phone died my advice do coop here get a 12 month lease and dont live with the girl you are dating
wwwstackmailcom  email vicechairuogamedevclub password wang2017 jonathan sent a photo and here is the information to hook it up to your phone or email client enjoy
any timw
what kind of file is it
change the name of it xyztxt to xyzcsv and try to open it after
use atom or sublime text 3 if you save it as a csv you can usually port it into your analytical tool without having to use excel
nope havent been using it long enough
but i know you can use sublime or notepad for shit like this bash can edit files yes but it would be a pain
jonathan ó°

perl script like just a few lines of perl script did you buy a mac
how much you pay
nice
nice nice use perl thats like  10 lines of code
yep its really easy to do itll be good to learn and know
nope you would simply run your perl script have it read the text file for you and output a new text file with what you want
i reckon what they meant was itll be easier using a unix system to do this
far more versatile and useful cmd is garbage unix and bash is the way to go all operations in the terminal no more gui bullshit and its completely optimized
exactly perl is the way to go for most scripting especially text file stuff easy quick effortless its what its used for you could also use python but i prefer perl
yep unix you just have to write the script
whats it all for
well i hope it works out
it is very useful especially in dev
8gb is fine but if you are getting an expensive computer go for 16gb
yes definitely longer value
busy busy busy with school exams midterms labs and assignments next one is due in an hour got to work
yes
nope in montreal
via rail trains
nope train optimization and efficiency yea its not them its cn
nope compsci
nope just how people use and work on the trains software can make everything better  compsci students are best prepared for problem solving they have the software engineers working on the testing and maintenance

shoot
you go to school you do midterms you do finals and you finish by the end of august end of july there are different sessions because some classes are condensed
pretty much and the may to july classes arent really condensed you just dont get a reading week
ends
yep all of them
you can do both you just have to let them know that you found a job outside the navigator before you accept a job in the navigator
and your waterloo friend is like all waterloo people they think they are better than literaly everyone
they think their shit dont stink and that waterloo is an all benevolent god of a school ive met my fair share of waterloo students that arent like that but these students are in engineering
arent in engineering
cs math and science
and their are a lot of nice coop jobs dont apply to all of them just the ones you like i as a rule of thumb dont apply to many government jobs if you apply for government chances are you will get an interview and an offer from them they dont get many exciting people haha
by rule you should apply within your own field
what do you mean shit jobs
i was correcting that the people from waterloo that arent assholes arent from engineering p the engineering jobs are some of the highest paid and quality jobs you can get my friends are in cs math and sciences
make sure to follow the instructions and apply on their website too
i generally apply to 30 places and get about 15 interviews but i have a very loaded resume so i tend to get a lot more than other people apply for everything that interest you and some government jobs
this is your first coop right chances are itll probably be government yep you can request to not get anymore if you hit 10
jonathan ó° but you wanted the ring so you must now suffer  not too late to switch to compsci in my books
lol for now just wait till 3rd year when classes narrow down and only software kids are there worse class i swear
thats a software kid haha it only gets worse haha
yea my specialization is big data and machine learning remind me to send you some links tonight
thanks for reminding me httpwwwinferenceorgukitprnnbookpdf this is what i used to learn machine learning and ai
anytime ill send you some more textbooks if you want
have these  jonathan sent some attachments these are the textbooks required for the machine learning and data science class here at the uni
the two i just sent should be easier to follow less technical and much more of a bottom up approach you know databases right
wait you switch to software right
not comp sci damn yea you arent going to touch any machine learning and data science stuff youll be doing more clientbusiness stuff less theory
you do have to take database 1 right
database 1 is fundamental to machine learning if you dont know proper database concepts machine learning will be very difficilt ok so this is what you should do save all that stuff i sent you for later
dont jump into machine learning just yet if you dont know the basics to proper database management itll really help long term trust me p
after database 1 and database 2 at uni it came pretty naturally most of it is high concept math and data mapping creating node modules and having them remember tree data based on data logic
i suppose if you arent the one modeling the data you could but the entire point of machine learning is 1 modeling the data and 2 using it
you have all this data right how do you store it you cant just do datastore to database you have to be direct you have to tell the guest exactly where the bathroom is for them to use it
alright im at an event let me know if you have questions and ill answer after
should have gone into compsci
iron ring means nothing  ill get you a ring of iron if you want
you could be spending that free time relaxing and enjoying life like gaming p
whats up
aye
yessir
sure
yep
any efficient algorithms that do light refraction worse case you do it for all of them
depending on the light source you would have to reflection thats what i meant as a worse case you do it for all particles
youll get more blocky lighting though
you should be able to calculate the difference between point x and y and assume the middle
lets say you have point x at 10 10 and point y at 10 20 you could calculate those two points and assume that since you know the light intensity at both these points you could predict the light intensity of all the other points
oh gotcha
i would create a vector map that keeps track of the objects in relation to the mirrors and the mirrors in relation to themselves and everything in relation to you
its a tad complex though
you can create vectors that describe interaction between all objects
imagine your mirror you calculate the angle from the object to the right side of the mirror and the angle of the object to the left side of the mirror this range becomes the reflective range in 3d space where the object can be seen in that mirror
its the only one that comes to mind that feels less expensive
any time let me know how it goes im really interested in seeing how you go about it
i enjoy the concept so my hopes are high
a little not much why do you ask
its pretty simple to use get a student account asap and there are a lot of tutorials online
not sure honestly its great at analytics im sure it does something similar
i honestly didnt work on watson so i cant really say p didnt work with anyone from watson either
yep whats up
no idea but you could give it arbitrary names that dont make sense like apple strawberry kiwi that way only you know the meaning
it wouldnt but if you look at a field called purple and it was a number youd have no idea what it is im just assuming you want to hide the json for security
its a specialization you sign up to it and have a different course sequence to follow that course sequence has data science machine learning information retrieval and artificial intelligence classes mandated to graduate
oh no worries  oh no probs he really is he said he was really happy to meet you cause you both have so much in common ð
yep he was a mutual friend  with another one of my friends
no the soft copy is due on blackboard this firday
im not sure but our lab ta sent out a notification on blackboard yesterday about the new deadline
sherry ó°
oh hey sorry only saw this now but i see youve found it
sherry ó° have you found a coop placementwork for the summer
wow 0  with who i had my last interview for coop during our iti class
wow
sounds really cool thats why ive always been pretty interested in healthcare area alongside with computer sci so yah x it was good i think
awh thats really nice of you to say thanks have you been doing any side projects
sherry ó°
is it the new entrepreneurial class
is hanan anis teaching it
i think my friends taking the class as well
her names nayaelah oh dear
yes
i believe so oh no shes early twenties
maybe shes taking another class ok
maybe
oh okay i think it might be that one then yesno yes im technically doing one but the progress is equivalent to 0 so not really x bio is taking a lot of my time rn data science
sounds super cool yah cell bio
well honestly the some guy dept head or something said they messed up the course sequence so im not sure i took physics 1 some with an accent on the e
you interested in data science
oh is he o
ahhh i see
whoa sounds rad whens the next meeting ill stop by i can share some of the invitations to some of my friends
cool shouldnt have anything on sat
cool do you have a fb page
coolio have you thought of doing an event page for your next meeting
easier to share around oh ok
ahh i see are you going to the next startup weekend in march
y ok
yes i do  nah i just saw it on facebook
aw i went home for the weekend im at home rn so wont be able to make the meeting tmr rip
thanks for letting me know though d
thanks you too  how was the meeting
yay  my friend manisha went she said you taught her some basic stuff about unix cool weekend of april 15th
ahh i might be able to come a bit late  i have a lab exam near noon
i think from 130 to 230 or something yah x for bio
thanks
hey frank hows everything going hmmm actually im not sure but from what i know coop interviews happen around midterm season which leaves enough time to figure out whether or not you find a placement before enrollment time
oooo niceee  welcome to the se family ð ohh do you program on the job or is it pure bio im doing okay work is alright doing some minor programming but a lot more testing honestly
how do you like bioinformatics ooooo i see
oh woah its research right
well if you think theyre not taking the right approach or have the right mindset towards certain problems you should tell them theres always more than one way to say it
the soft skills
hm  really good experience  youll know how to work with these kinds of people in the future
youd be surprised how people deal with certain situations
i mean we sometimes make judgments about how people will react to what we dosay that arent always true
just try talking to people
whether they do anything about is well  up to them but at least you tried and its better knowing that you tried making things better
my conjecture since i have no experience in the research field whatsoever is that people are doing research to make discoveries publish papers trying to make a name for themselves and as fast as possible so if what theyre doing isnt efficient by wasting time believing that everything is infallible then by providing them with a better way to deal with their situations is only a benefit to them
well im also not as extroverted as you think i am  so were in the same boat
its alright kind of boring actually enough to make me fall asleep at work almost every day hehe
my coworker came over once and he was like yo sherry look alive it looks bad sleeping at work  oh i know haha funny im not smart
no i have a long way to go
lol i get mine from my sis its just passed around really x shes older than you
27 27
well shes working right now in mountain view at some genetic company ahahaha i forgot
bio  chem she graduated with a biochem eng degree
hm i suppose
y cools coolz np tell me how it goes
hm blender ok will take a look
ð did you get more interviews
noice
whens your first interview
15
dang which 3 do you have
hm idk x i havent gotten a chance to look through everything yet im going to look through everything tonight later today hbu
true
true theres a few thats pending in my applications that im super interested in but unfortunately they cancel your application after you get 15 rip
oh well
no they should tell you
 how many did you end up applying to
whoa
sherry ó°
lol what a baller ottawau
sounds very familiar
ahhhh okay think i may have seen him at cusec
actually this is weird im friends with him on fb x
i dont think so well i guess i wasnt formally introduced to him some of my friends said hi to him in the hallway but i never talked to him
sherry ó°
i just asked about the mentorship  typical look at what coop students do hbu
sherry ó° nice interested to hear what he said about the work from home question
y
i didnt get ranked with them ðð but yay nice d
uhm i guess
ð
no not really
y and gng for me as well  btw do you have fiona on fb
whats her last name
okay thats fine
hm cant find her x whats her profile pic
yo  its gouda so 1 quiz 2 is marked
2 next quiz date is to be determined apparently hes ahead of the other profs  they need to coordinate to find a good time wont be this week though to give the test
theres another one i think and french section too if im not mistaken lol apparently the other prof recommended everyone take our profs class or something
haha true httpsbookstoregithubiocsesecondyearcomputersystemarchitecture20manopdf
apparently theres one next week i think i wasnt in class so im not 100 sure
welll no so im also gonna read the textbook ð
oh what ð whered you find this
oo there is one
nope ð hahaha at least i dont think so
okie still going on
sherry ó°
no but she told other people ð
nope she talked about what else is on the quiz its something on dgd 8 filling in the table
sherry ó° sherry sent an attachment
friend
ð
sherry ó° ya so it shouldnt be too bad  easy 100
ahaha how so
ah i mean thats what you get when you have an educational system built upon a numberinggrade system but i def believe that there is a lot of stressanxiety in general about grades
oh thats true meaningful thats subjective isnt it to someone who finds grades meaningful then we have a different story but i see where youre coming from
well i mean if you think about it were in school for almost 15 of our lives
thats a long time
if were going to dedicate so much time  money to being in school i think theres good reason in taking time to get good grades
additionally in terms of getting good grades its def important if you want to pursue even higher education
oh okay so youre saying people should focus on learning vs setting out to get good grades i completely agree with you there
got it
ya i talked to two successful people one of them peng and yah grades dont have an effect in the workplace
pengs an advocate for grades dont matter he preaches and practices what he says
value
oh my bad nice  yah since youre super into game dev
ahhh okie
the past quizzes
nah dont worry about it
y yoyo
howd you book a fss room last year for gaming club
oh fo realzie
hm okay i see thanks do you still have access to the system
okay
having an external meeting not ottawau club related and i dont want to book a dingy old library study room that smells like rotten pizza half the time x
lol mostly the 24 hour ones
anywhoo ill fig it out thanks y
yepp
no i think everythings being tested
with a slightly heavier focus on the latter chapters
that im not sure prof didnt really say anything specific other then everything is testable
sherry ó° httpsdrivegooglecomfiled1elo6n6y9mqnljfnatz9ju0jql7gqviewuspsharing someone sent me this might be of help
sherry ó° did you ever download the ceg textbook from the link i sent youã
can you send it to me
swang261uottawaca
ok
got it
reading over lecture slides  referring to textbook for stuff i think i need more clarification on and then dgds labs and questions i can do to practice how about you
sherry ó°
i donât think so did you do the quizzes
oh
sherry ó° honestly coop is just a passfail grade
and pretty sure these quizzes are just optional yeeessss 3 are you
phreesia
oh really ripppp what are your work hours
sherry ó° same are you excited
hm i donât think they will be
iâm sure youâll meet real hip middle aged peeps there  other interns hopefully
most people are nice so iâd say finding an asshole might actually be difficult
ohhh nice general statement
oh i guess industry people
i guess i havenât dealt  with assholes before hehe
hm i guess
but then again in research people are actually super knowledgeable about the subject in the industry we have people who arenât experts managing very knowledgeable peeps arenât always
loool weâll see i guess i kinda wanna meet and work with people who are arses just to learn how to deal with all sorts of peeps
oh yikes is that effective
ouf man maybe they might just be completely unaware of how theyâre treating other people
in that case i think a head on horn to horn approach might not be the best cause you probably donât want to escalate the situation idk maybe like a one on one
oh okay
well itâs not easy to admit that youâre wrong whoa i think thatâs a really good skill to have actually
yeppers i think a 30 minute ish bus ride maybe like 10min car ride yah thatâs about right better than bussing to and from school  yours is probs 15hours one way
or just 1 hr
oh sweet
wow thats super nice
yah i need to get my g2 still lmao
yep i took lessons with an instructor like a year ago and he was really calm and nice no yelling or anything
or maybe it was because i was such a great driver ðð ð yo when my sister was practicing with my dad so many fights ð
yes
lmao rippp
yep that sounds pretty accurate
man asian parents are so shorttempered yeah true
my dads been like yo sherry lets go driving but i keep postponing it lol
and when i ask my mom to tutor me shes like im scared to sit in a car with you i mean like thanks mom for the trust lol
i know right
yah shes like cmere yet food x asian parents
kind of boring
i mean some days were fun cause i met up with friends ate delish food
yep i didnt do anything slept a lot so that was nice but yah overall it was pretty boring ahahaha how about you
ooooh sounds pretty productive
lol either way good or bad motivation at least you worked on it  oh yah something like that i also did that during this break watched a bunch of old movies  the greatest showman which was really good
oh lol man i just watch what i can find lol
yah pretty much im that kinda person who always finishes what theyre watching even if its bad
i skip over some parts but still its a waste of time lol
nope dont watch anime
that was an exception x a lot of my friends recommended it to me actually correction i watch anime movies occasionally
probs
okay true
coolzies
yes lets
oh cool
yep hamzas working at phreesia too see ya
kid in software eng same yer year as us
oh search up hamza basrai on fb
guy wearing suit sherry ó°
you too
sherry ó°
the goal setting thingy
nope i didnât bring it up
and my boss didnât say anything where was this announced email
mom kk yah iâll probs do it then have you done it yet mmm
sherry ó° howâs work
and first week in general oh i did it last coop itâs really relaxed though
i forgot tbh
yay nice other coops or are you the only one
ooo okay pretty good better than my first with 3 other coops idk if i mentioned this earlier
learned some new stuff
yep
itâs the first year theyâve done it sherry ó° weâre kind of all training and learning rn which is nice also they have a lot of free food so iâm happy
ye
really honestly feel the opposite
ooo ok
lol i figured thatâs what you meant
um yes and no p iâm on the organizing committee
ahahahhahahahaha hopefully it isnât 450 hackers
sherry ó°
how was the western hackathon no themes this year
yeeee and yess
no no no category prizes but some of them will be judges though
yes of course skys the limit
yay good luck
sherry ó° looking forward to it
sat morning the schedule should be up on uottahackcom
yes i think so whatâs up
ahh okie how come delayed response lmao
ahh okay
true sure
yes iâm free after work today or lunch time whatever your pick

okay iâm coming yo you should invite us to cienna p ciena p
sherry ó°
sure shoot away
i read your short blurb and i thought that it was really well written thought with all of your experience you would have gotten on and i voted for you too ð­
ok okay nice
hm iâd say thatâs hard to tell especially since we donât have access to this information how many ppl voted who these ppl are and iâm sure some of your friends like me p voted for you too
okay i see where youâre coming from i had no insight into how any of the other candidates approached this election
so i can only speak for myself okay thatâs up to you i guess hahaha thatâs nice of your friend  coop
i told ppl to checkout their emails for voting at my coop place and they were like nah ð
yah haha oh well theyâre great ppl
i mean some people told me they were voting for me
which was so nice anywho have you taken a look at the schedules for courses yet you canât enroll in them but the schedule is out
you are
with ciena
holy moles
no so start from beginning and spill
everything donât leave dets out
ð±ð±ð± holy moles
whatâs your position
okay so thatâs hella cool
wooooow
wow you speak japanese
fluently cool good night

sherry ó° how was bc
yes nice
good and ye qa is good sherry sent an attachment
it should be on bright space
not quite
haha sure whats up ive only done a bit was going to potentially work on it in our friday lab

yes
weird
sure test 70 lines covered test class
class 72 lines covered thats for question 3 of the lab
for the tutorial i got 955

not twiddling thumbs this time  data  a bit of ml
ayyyy nice
true iâm so excited to work here
howâs the food yah i honestly think so
in regards to work though lmao
iâve watched vids before on the cafeterias they have in japan apparently one of the most amazing cafeterias in the world was not watching cafeteria related videos just stumbled upon them
lol thought i should clarify
sounds accurate howâs the main facility you work at
haha understandable we have the same policy oooooo nice sounds fun lol this reminds me sherry called you wei asked me once whether we were siblings ð also i pressed call by accident hehe
lmao well i told him âjust because we have the same last name doesnât mean weâre siblingsâ thatâs why i question his asianness lmao
yes but wang is literally one of the most common surnames in china
but i mean iâd thought heâd think twice before asking precisely because he is asian
okay youâve got me
sherry sent a sticker lol
sherry ó° nice have fun
omg hi long time no talk hows work
hows life
i only have 1 week left of workkk until school 3

really o whoa damn
i mean over here we get christmas and new year off do you get a few extra days off around new years
oh hahah i see
i think i definitely enjoyed it more
still cant see myself working full time after graduating though for life 33333 yes definitely i think the social aspect really helps too
i think i mentioned before but im working with 20 other coops
weve all gotten to know each other pretty well oh okay hows yours going so far
is this one better then your previous one
i dont remember if i asked you before but did you get any form of culture shock when you got to japan oh sweet
oh interesting my gosh i honestly dont know how some people do it
hahahaha nice
uhm challenging at certain points yes and definitely worthwhile i was actually excited to go to work most days as weird as that sounds lmao
yes are you back in school during the summer
oh wow work in japan no
iâll probs be doing my next coop awesome where will you be working
interesting do you know what kind of work youâll be doing
neat
looks like youâll be working for 12 months straight huh
truer will you be doing any other clips after coops man autocorrect lol
wooooooow that looks incredible iâm so jealous lmao
sounds like it honestly did you explore any other parts of japan
i mean im sure tokyo is also a fantastic place to explore  hows all the food i think i may have asked earlier lmao but i forget now

zihan sent a photo
i dont know i just followed its instruction and wait and wait
zihan sent a photo this one
this one i dont know exactly where the stage is since i was doing sports at that time
so do i need to stop the installation of visual studio
 alright finished
seems like that
so can i delete visual
awesome so we need to create a new account first
ok oh did we have a meeting last saturday i remember you hold meetings every two weeks
alright so next meeting will be held on next semester and what do i need to do with our program during holiday
can i join both teams i think they have common sides
alright i have make decision after i see the outline will zihan sent a photo which onei have already opened every single file but
tomorrow before 1130 or after 1 where is your residence
which room
ok
npwould be there im there
oh shit i can only find 75
ok im before law building
nope coordinate
at 75
zihan sent a photo hey manis it ok right track
but it doesnt work for me see the next lineit always prints false
zihan sent a photo i assume its wrong
yeafor this one like whatits last logic problem for this game
so i cant set a point to captured
i think there is something wrong with setcaptured so the code in last photo i sent is wrong
yea i knowbasically its the set method in dotinfo goes like shut
same problem what should i do with set in dotinfo thats the last
what does your iscaptured only return captured
oh yea you are right so fucking stupid love you man your so cool now everything looks fine
no i mean np
ofc im interested
 wait what are you talkgoing big about talking about
no doubt ofc i will come
but at least you need to let me know what to do during session
which room
zihan sent a photo same room
nice work
nvm how many people there
ok can you tell me how the game goes
i mean overall
oh so you are doing one level design
can you actually control the character
 so after todays meeting you can play game in one level
awesome really want to help still not good enough
i know idea but how ive already been left behind
tough challenge
orz so what else can i do i need some visual tasks
coding
so basically eveyone codes here
ok i can try but i may not know some advanced
what does that lady do
no i mean previously
understandable yea
but sometimes hard to guess what to code to like make it transforms to other types
à² à²°à³ give me one more week let me get a little familiar with c
yo are you frank in piazza
what
no just wondering
alright i think no just thinking
nvm i just want to verify my assumption
god which part are you working on right now
orz i dont like torus honestly good luck
are you free i have one question
zihan sent a photo for this one what would be points that the top left point connects to in torus case diagonal
thanks bud
hey bud is model controlling the state of game
 what do you mean by state of game
not quite i mean the current view of game
ya but it controls the information of the game
yes you r right so we need variables to record the the play mode in model
 but i didnt revise any of model class maybe i am wrong
what you mean those control the play mode
i use jradioburton not joptionl
actually i use some variables to record what options i clicked and then using it statement to distinguish the conditions
if
but all are done in controller yo before choosing initial dotcan we change play mode
bud once you pop the clone modelhow do you make it replace the original model
what do you mean and then make the views model the same
so another clone model has to be added to view
zihan sent a photo i dont know why this one doesnt work
no steps indeed decrease but color doesnt change
in viewupdate method thismodel  model other remain in controller i set modelclone gamemorelmodrl5clone before select next color
click uodocolor does not change after that click dog againit continues as if i didnt click undo alright i will try
if want to check them its kind of strange method i used
 lets take an easy one where do you push clone model into stack
i mean before select color or after
ya but controller controls many parts still think before select new color
nvm hey buddo you use circular array in torus mode ya we dont need that man are you freetoday
ok anytime after 4
ya for sure its just regarding undo
already finish clone
no
terak told me if you finish lab5 you dont have to go lab6 if you dont finish you can come and finish it in so called lab6
np
ya
on my way
ok
wanna improve efficiencyhow many methods flood do you use to handle four play modes
no i mean in code linesright now i am using 4 methods to handle four modesinefficient
ok
alrightyours are super efficient
i use lots of if statements alright hey do you put your redo and undo stack in controller or model
ok i just wonder that prof said on pizza that it makes much more senses to put that in model
perfectnice comrade waitone more question do we need to implement removefirstaddlast method in linkedlist which is in linearfrequency table
but thats for part23 not for part 1
what
use linkedlist class need to implement iterator methodtot shi files are not in order
sounds good yo how much do we pay
yo how would you achieve recursion
yea but it doesnt have any parameter
o u r right i asked this question but prof didnt reply that so  orz how do you handle condition when top is nullwhen stack is empty and you need to roll it
ok one more in part 1when it says initialize itmeans add one elem to linkedlist with value string
so just like initialize it and add it to list
nice oh yea thanks already finished seems like no club activity today
then in different room i think
ââ¿âï»¿ so can you tell me what you did today i may have to practice in summer
code ok
so just 2d
but you r doing 2d
ok where is that cinema
i need  at least 82on exam to reach adamn
im not sure thats why i say damn fuck ahhhh hope ta wont be strict on this exam
nice this is my first time to get a strictly depending on otherswhat a shame for me
thats for next year and the threshold for coop is 80
in color program coop the enrollment says so
np already in ceecoop hey  i just want to know if you took mat1322 and learnt section 95 linear equations
did prof 1121 really said the worst assignment would be removed sup
somebody asked it on pizza and he said the same for us
last one only my tree doesnt work fine
ok

yea i knowjust feel uncomfortable about that sometime
okthanks for your advice i will take action
good gotta review again
oh sorry bud i didnt check your text thats my convention of reviewing stay away from social mediaââ¿âï»¿
not bad except iterator forget some of the basic concepts pretty easy
cool enjoy your vacation
oh cool finally got a on 1100
there must be some mysterious power force prof to give me a
oh cool how much do you get on that i havent received yet
thats good
lolhope i can get at lest a

emmm just start learning unity hopefully it isnt too late what about you
well thats good
ð³ asian
ð
wow thats awesome in ottawa  or toronto
ahhh so you changed program successfully
ð
all settled is interview hard
ð thats pretty good news
ð© idk what can a computer engineer do in his first two year
ð¬
hardware not that good as ee emmm like unity
or robotics
emmm thats a good point to me
ya thats remind meneed to be working harder
idk but im willing to absorb something new btw do you dress in suit thiurghout interview or just online
gotta nobut may have one in aprilidk havent got any email about coop yet

will try
ðð you are right thanks buddy

zihan sent a photo see game type third line
oh
spell it incorrectly

emmm
ââ¿âï»¿
well  how long is the game process
emma longer than crisis 3 and cod
during summer
ok i will double check it dude tot
ya im downloading
the latteryou know chinese people know these ways well
not that much difference
lol
ok ok
ohhh see you have nice dreams yo can you see any content posted under csi category
yo just came out with these bunch of codes  cant find where mirror script is attached to so take a look at itits in mirror script zihan sent a photo zihan sent a photo
but i cant test it need add a new transform
mirror attached to which object
zihan sent a photo didnt see mirror
zihan sent a photo still no mirror script
zihan sent a photo this one

zihan sent a photo is this line of code controlling the rotation of phone around world center
will try actually what do you mean by the position  of phone
you want the phone moves along player
cant it be child of player
no you can change that manually
ok do you know when our meeting time is
need some
ok
emmm yo dude when is thanks giving again
got you btw happy moon festival you may know that
do you know when is our first meeting
so everything is discussed on discord
welldo you know what kind of project we are planning
ðð©
o i see dude im not pretty sure that do we have classes on monday
oh good news frank wassup  would you do me a favor
can you take some photos when you go to naruto running
its held at20th
ooohh thiught you were interested in that
hows your coop going
the one near the river  game company
you submitted resume to 15 companies thats a lot dude
holy thats amazing are they all nonracially biased
ðð i thought too much anyways good luck to your results
ââ¿âï»¿ so bored these days still no game design
doing
how good you means personality or skills
ya
that really depends on if i am busy
ââ¿âï»¿ for sure man do you have any plan during reading week sup man do you know what will be held on game club first event other than board games
sounds fair you go there
tot be socialized i mean myself
ãããªã until now  i still donât have too many english speaking friends
ahhh stress me a lot yo man in csi 2110 a2 part 1 how do you store a string value in a treenodenot nodewithdata
okwell so how do you do insertdecide when to go left or right
currently iâm using substring which is shut shxt
index mess up boom
so using char scharatindex ohalmost got itand in search method we are actually finding if there is a node true at position where that string is supposed to be
ââ¿âï»¿
nojust saying your method works yo whatâs up man
ââ¿âï»¿ no bad tho
donât know yet  but now is getting closer to both computer and software design kinda stressful
why
huhhonestly iâm more interested in coding for current state since i donât know too much about hardware but will see what will happen in third year
sec year
you become stronger and become bald oh so he switches to soft
oh shut but iâm not interested in software design neither too many diagrams
actually i havenât decided which path to go in future â robotics or game
or more utilitarian financial programmer
 come on man actual body is hotter than metal and softer
lmao soon btw howâs your coop going
lol cool man
 you can buy a second hand car
your loan
omg
what is that about database
ok ok i see maybe you can give somebody your body as exchange for your tuition daddy
hhh thatâs just universal acknowledged joke gotta do some body training see you
yo can you tell me where do you find your references for your resume
i mean the person as reference
ooo got it may i get your name as my reference my brother as team leader
thank you dude i will then list you as game design leader whatâs your email address
vv whatâs your email address again
ðð i have a questionâif an assignment says tier 1 do x  tier 2 do y would that mean we only do either x or y but not both
îµîµîµîµîµîµâï¿£âï¿£â damnit iâm seriously considering switching to software
ops so that means i canât get into software program in winter if i applied now
next fall
i just checked course sequencei found a fact that electrival can do  what we computer eng do but not vice verse and same for software so computer eng is amb
yasoftware design security assuranceâm
but we need basic knowledge from courseâright
oh really
sure
only resumeiâm not sure tho i mean first impression is important too
âoh you are in software you must good at programming you are in computer eng you must good at hardwareetcâ
zihan ó° certainly right
ofc not would rather spend one year working
zihan ó°
thatâs for advice i will consult if there is any without delaying my grad
personal project ya iâm still trying to do some unity
y oï¾â½ï¾o zihan sent a photo do you know why edgeâ0â has four vertices
c
wasup
what happened
hhh
that sounds good do you have group
would you mind form one with me
lol i canât guarantee that good luck  man
100
lol ok
no i didnât say i usually get 100
ihhh 9095 sometimes 98
sorry dude
ok ok
i canât find it the interface
zihan sent a photo
done
 damnfast
i will look through the codes tonight
jut wondering how many days have you been working on a4
impressive is it that easy or you are superman
lol to a certain degree i agree readmetro should be static method
âyou should create a static method readmetrofilename which will read the dataâ
i will get my one version of implementation and then i send it to you
own q1
no working on that
ok i will first look at read method well i think you should have only one readline in you read method if you have two  it will skip once
nvm
forget about what iâm saying
tot didnât notice first line is not data ok so your stationid is not four digits
ya i know just saying â i printed 0001 and result is 1
got it lol i thought it was 0001
anyway so far it tests  fine one question
is it necessary to use substring to cut the empty string
shxt just wondering why prof never answers my question
zihan sent a photo zihan sent a photo maybe you can answer â´à¼àº¶ðà¼àº¶
lol
i was wondering if i could use dfs  alright
lol ok but it seems like i donât do anything
 insane dude so you did them without printline
well
oh ya i see
tot lol alright
ok will try my best
95 for sure hah
see ya
maybe use graph traversal one connected component
oook will try ââ¿âï»¿
ok ok must it be done in same order
zihan sent a photo
it seems to be
ya i think i can start tonight may you send your code
right so i just need to comment your algorithm
oh ya i will try it tonight may i delete one of your printshortestpath you have two in graphal class
right
 i see they have been commented intelligent do you print total traversal time
zihan sent a photo which oneââ¿âï»¿
i donât quite understand why do we need entryintegervertexv  canât we just use maphash instead  line193
ya i am looking through it i can send you the code right now
i think i finish my part i tested with the first test case provided and the one you gave looks fine
itâs pretty straightforward  except i use set of keys to print keys and i commented it
document zihan sent a photo
also i comment your pathprint method
so i just need to explain part 1 in details iâll send you code
zihan sent an attachment in main method plz comment line198 out forgot doing that can you access to yo zone
uozone
uoaccess
make  rather than  before dfs
ok so make it xxxx
ok i thought mine is small function that doesnât need too much detail à² à²°à³
hhh okok will do right now
later zihan sent an attachment
oh forget output
zihan sent a photo what code
remove is not mine
ok i will comment them in 5mins
which one you sent three versions tot
data structure
adjacency map
 what do i need to explain how to build this map etc
oh sure i will do my best
ya im using it shall we remove the removeedge method
so printing stationid instead of name ok i will have a look at ot
no i think you can just modify the printing method ill try on that
zihan sent a photo
i  think we read id as well
no i didnt change
zihan sent a photo ya that works
zihan sent a photo only 2
test 3 failed input     n1  0 n2  288 n3  3
ya im working on that
almost do you fix that
test 3
ok i will send them by 5pm check your email
i donât know man  some outputs for test2 and 3 are exactly same
no i mean part3 some of them have same answer as part2 just not sure
ya
input     n1  0 n2  288 n3  3 no computer available now
ok ok assume you are right ðð
yesmaybe make some comment about this oneï¼ can do if you want ðð
ok well if you say soð¤ð¤ go ahead dude
ð¤£ð¤£
well iâll take responsibility
ð¤ð¤
à² à²°à³ well i would only test it
ok i trust you yiu can submit it
â´à¼àº¶ðà¼àº¶  ìâ ì then i will submit it tonight
îµîµîµîµîµîµâï¿£âï¿£â yo do you have enough references
ðð i will add some myself whatâs your student
submitted
 we still have time
oh cool
no
à² à²°à³ hold on just remember i added a if statement in my dfs â´à¼àº¶ðà¼àº¶
one line of code easy one you can add it
ya so i added if statement iâll send you zihan sent an attachment
yes
i tested node 7 which has 1 and node 2 which doesnt it worked
sounds good ganbadie
lol thatâs awesome donât forget change your output examples in doc

i donât know  some regions in g
airbus gonna have interview there not at schoolðð
next tuesday
lol ok but i have very low chance getting job iâm not billingual
i hope soð 1 question
how would you response to these zihan sent a photo i know merely of them rarely
okðð¬
ok i get it i will at least try to understand what they are one question  does french understand english   in gatinue region
ok cool yo are you still running ugame club
cool  iâm gonna take summer course
well yes french one rejected me so no interview job
43 for second round 13 still pending
i wanted to  some of these jobs opened only for citizen tot
not too many though less than first round obviously
haha thatâs right
maybe switching to software more conpectitive
competitive
ya i am trying to write some python scripts
yes  thatâs what i think more competitive during summer term on yes what aspect do you learn in ml field  neutral network or deep learning
no i donât think so
from mit open courses
oh dam i see
you pay to learn nice investment
i see
oh ya you check ai google as well
cool such a self initiative man sensei
zihan sent a sticker yo what is hackthon
so people just live there overnight  and how do you form a team
ok i see any this kind of event in this summer
yes thatâs what i think
iâm switching to software eng
 i found myself not that much interest in hardware design

well cs is for future development
graduate student etc
orz wt
maybe but i find cs course schedule is kind of boring
you need to take 9 non computing courses
à² à²°à³
right but we still have four free electives right
not quite

lol
i know itâs kind of weird but for us international students the very first priority is to be able to find a job if i were in china instead of canada i will take 9 electives with no hesitation
aaaahh thatâs reality against expectation
maybe i hope so at least i think itâs better than ce need to use my electives effectively
i know that thatâs how it work
 oh damn
â´à¼àº¶ðà¼àº¶ i was retarded
lol  right i need to do more hands on project during summer
no i took too many extra elg courses
i can be faster in seg
 because i took some of the courses this summer  i can take only three courses
no if coop is considered no i mean i can take less courses each semester in average are you studying this summer
 i will follow youâ»â»
thatâs great îµîµîµîµîµîµâï¿£âï¿£â
thatâs right  but it turns out that unity project doesnât really help yes i learned it
ðð
then what can you do
i want some more practical experience
ððð
well i see maybe i need to deeply consider that again
learn something new alright i will do some ml algorithm stuff
zihan ó°
awesome 91 off do you have any related ongoing project
i can join you ml
can you apply ml to game dev
when
lol so you wonât be at school this year
well so you still in school during summer  i can still learn from you ð¤ð¤
see ya zihan sent an attachment pleaze ignore
lol damn you are right cs seems to be a better choice for me
i donât wanna narrow myself on just software development yes just let me talk to my parents first
lol but iâm gonna take some summer courses as well both application side and theory side
ðhave to wait till next lecture have you formed any group
â´à¼àº¶ðà¼àº¶ what about lab
ok me too we can form a group  does he say we can form a group up to 3 people  if your partner is doing html stuff may i join i zihan sent a photo
zihan sent a photo where are you dude
try to wave your hand
extra seat over there
i will come next lecture  usually first lectur is just introduction not that important
ohitâs quite a âluck â to meet this prof
he taught  me seg2105 2106
personally speaking  heâs not really good
shit on 2105  a on 2106 but thatâs bacsially because i reviewed course with lecture slides from other session
did your partners switch to se already
partners in your ui project i remember they are both cs did they switch
 ok but i saw them last semester

well i seee
not yet you have one
 ok we can send email to prof
next week
zihan chen 8710479
yes
name  frank wang
ok zihan sent a photo
zihan sent a photo up to this slide mostly introducing hardware
 trust me  you will finally fall to sleep when you listen to him
oh did you go for a trip
zihan sent a photo wtf
yes  thatâs what i think this is first time i know this stupid rule
ðshe said i donât need yo i can just apply online she said â
ya to be honest  i didnât expect i would be rejected  plus i think real time system is cool
godd maybe they were first year student
 do you know anyone who is switching as well bias
ð¤ï¸ðð they should give me their position
finished the first lecture
no
 usually where do you have your lunch
nah iâm heading to nordstrom to have lunch
ya i know  but there is no such a option for switching
zihan sent a photo only csi and cdi with math
we have csi this friday lab
yes first lab is easy tho
i can submit the file if you want yes i have some questions
nah itâs fine first lab is easy lol
ð
thatâs for mac no for windows not for mac
i canât use browser with my linux vm let me take photo of my code zihan sent a photo
no  cygwin is just a tool  like ubuntu  and he said mac is unix based so mac users donât need to worry that
windows so iâm using ubuntu
just type commands in my terminal everything works the same
are you able to open your terminal
did you type those command
those from part b  have a try if you didnât
right
thatâs correct
new a file and type those stuff in it
first open a text editorâ put them in itâ save it as xxxc
and then use step 6 finally step 7
not really but you need it to start the program
no system canât find the file
i think it matters i save all files in home directory
yes compile the file
photo let me have a try
sry i canât find the problem  seems like you are doing exact the same as instruction  zihan sent a photo
ahhh can you submit the lab c file  my firefox crashes constantly
run this one see if this works zihan sent an attachment i can run it  but i cannot open webpage in linux
my linux vm doesnot allow me to access internet
no  my webbrower crash
the command binls only exists in unix and linux i think
btw did you finish your proposal for seg3125ï¼
cool
no
what are you going gtodo ook i see
ha i see our team is trying to do educational website too
ha but we are doing proraming one like w3scjool
right
i remember they are used to pause parent and return something of child if itâs finished not sure
do we have lab tomorrow
ok good zihan sent a gif
no this is the intro for 20 itâs published
zihan sent an attachment
this one is latest version im not gonna touch it zihan sent an attachment quiz today
he finished scheduling
any recommended places for lunch
one question how do you know we need mockups for 3125 phase1
 damn do we need to show them mockup
ah ok are you ok with lab4
ok i will leave it to you ð¤£ððð
btw i saw you yesterday
ð
ððð did you finish csi3131 assignmne question2
ahhow do you implement that monitor or semaphores
 ugh how to do that with monitor
i learned monitor last semester but iâm not sure so did you use condition as well
and locklock and unlock  how does it relate to semaphore
ahh defeated so basically you have one monitor associated with a binary semaphore that only one chief can use and you implement all functionalities in that monitor
ok i will try on that did you write any pseudo code for q2
one quick question what if chief 1 finished  what happened to chief 23 do they do anything
so they just wait there
good thanks
ya
for what zihan sent a photo ð
sry i was doing my 3125 lab i may donât know reason
true well he noted the reason zihan sent a photo hi do you know whatâs the submission date for 3125 project phase 2
oh ok for 3125lab are you using socalled one page website

hey belated hbd hope youre having a good time at pgcrl  networking lunch this wednesday maybe ill see you then
yes  sickkids is good
have you discovered any good food around here
which ones have to gone to is there any ssure seminar this week
missed that one i think lol where did you get this info i dont think im on the email list for ssure
oh okay oh well too many talks too little time lol
debugging sounds stressful i was also running around so tis cool lol
hey stanley and i are sitting on the third floor outside the salter auditorium come join if you can
hey did you start on your abstract writing yet do you know if we have a guideline
lol i just started this morning el oh el
i know  i have so much work to do in such a short amount of time
other work stuff meetings etc anyway
lol thanks btw i think the character max is 2000
if you go onto the eventbrite submission page it has a short blurb
i dont know lol
which means you did most of the work p thats great
making education modules sigh its not really research
i mean there is a research component to it but because i need to make the modules first i dont have the energy to devote to qualittaive resarch
i guess its medical education  qi only really exciting to someone in medicine
i hope so hehe hows your project going g
thats the dream analysis of data ugh never got to that point really
yeah haha oh well i did gain something out of it  i think its a very valuable experience just that with research in general i had this goal i never fulfilled
nothing cuz we dont control funding lol
yeah my first pi apparently got more funding recently so maybe its been fixed
hehe on a different note i think its a really good call that you switched into computer science
i think you can apply what you learn to science and they need people
yeah the way i see it this is like the industrial revolution
just like they needed people who can operated machine they need people who can code
haha its transferable
yes being adaptable i clearly am not ive tried to learn coding more than id like to admit lol ð
recommendations yeah
thats okay  thanks will look into it
medicine isnt as stable as people imagine tbh you sacrifice a lot but youre right it can be a lot more stable than many other fields
that is very true the grass is always greener elsewhere lol but i am grateful for what i have
haha be with your best friend yes my high school best friends is in med and its great although she is similar to me in the sense that we always want to branch out to other things
of course but i think its wonderful sometimes to have a different perspective medicine consumes you so stanley is lucky to have you tbh
lol
it shows a bit we chatted briefly about our future plan in medicine he seems a bit nonchalant buti think he does have things he wants to do and he will work for it
so you two are very different
so you consider that a good thing
that right there sounds like stanley
all for four
friends do that you know tina sent a sticker
when do you go back to ottawa
technically september 3 but i leave for china on august 20
haha yes i am just going home to visit family
yes to both i speak mandarin
about once a year or once every two years
well my entire family is there
no my immediate family as in my parents and grandparents
long story short my family got immigration status in 2008 so my mom and i came here first but then my mom fell ill and passed away so its just me now i have citizenship
wait what how did you evaluate me beforehand lol
but yes it gives me a rather interesting medicine perspective
shanghai
hell yea shanghai is like the toronto of china
haha well beijing is probably what toronto wouldve been had it been the capital of canada beijing is also very urban just not as efficiently designed as shanghai imho they are both cultural centres but a bit different
china has changed a lot in 15 years even shanghai has
my building used to be surrounded by farms now they are all highrises
yea it still has some part of history historical stuff is making a come back but in a different way
its like vinyl making a comeback people talk about preserving culture
i dont know it is a bit ironic and ridiculous at times
i cant speak to any specific examples but idont think that is the case
i feel pretty far removed from a lot of chinese culture stuff now not by choice id like to learn but at the same time i also need to learn about the history of my current country lol
so much you can learn about the different school of thought that determined the societal values the literature the history chinese calligraphy in itself can be a lifelong pressure puesuit pursuit
haha no but instead of reading old chinese lit i read western classic learning about history of christianity and its influence on western society instead of confucius
they just come up for example i like photography and art and they are very much influenced by history and intellectual movements same with music and movies
i ran his club
tina sent a sticker why
your cover photo okay
haha do you cook a lot no thats cool i like photography talks my brain food
lemme check i didnt look too in detail
haha
well now youve told me i can point out the nonrealistic
yes haha one can argue that photogahy is about understanding light
hmmm can i get back to you on that need to stare at it more
yay
i finished it but i want to polish it gonna look at it again later today
i wrote a project description for my quality improvement application mostly using that
yes i did send her but it probably wont be back in time
i probably would be more proactive if it were lab research because then id have real results lol ð
yes i did its a good change i think its good for me its actually my own fault that my clinical reasoning skills are not strong enogh otherwise this project wouldve gone a lot faster
nah its not about impact its about my understand of a clinical assessment oh well i learned
yeah i believe stanley is coming back soonish should properly grab coffee together
august 4 i thought
lol classic stanley
i can see that
didnt say i did put sub headings in mine
you finished yours
reviewing it one last time with my two supervisors time tmrw then im gonna submit
ah bread and butter of research
funding abstract
aka me ð oh yeah
yes
no thats fair some people are always living by deadlines deadlines are their number one adrenaline source
i procrastinate sometimes as well but its mroe a matter of priority lol if i dont think its important i leave it to last minute  i dont procrastinate study or assignments
i usually start studying for exams at least one week early i hate studyingworking under pressure
unncessary pressure
but things like errands i tend to procrastinate el oh el i agree
yeah i just end up hating myself last time it happened i had to write a grant application not because i procrastinated the writing but because i was convinced of applying three days before deadline
my program director lol i chatted with him and i was like theres no genetic lab in windsor and thats relaly the only thing im interested in
then he emailed the head of the science department who recommended him some names and i emailed one of them who did his phd in the lab one floor above my old lab
i think he just really wanted more people to apply which i understand
he still didnt have many applications when he talked to me so he was tryingt o convince me last minute
he was like theres totally time lol to be fair i met with him a week earlier it was the email exchange etc that took a few more days
yup hes trying really hard for our campus i appreciate it i think theres the possibility of medical schools cutting spots which means regional campuses are probably gonna be hit the first
haha nah
no it will not affect people already in medical school
ts not confirmed yet but at this rate it seems likely there is one thing that may suck for people getting in late though selfincorporating the government may eliminate that
physicians are technically selfemployed so they can actually become incorporated which means they are only subject to business tax maxed at 30 i believe while personal income tax can go up to 55 55 marginal tax rate
i mean i can still be selfemployed just that i have to pay way more tax it is quite honestly a huge tax loophole
i mean your parents are not completely wrong physicians do get paid a lot and comparatively your skills are valuable anywhere it is stable and high paying but you have to be willing to make sacrifices
what i can tell you is that there is no objectively perfect job using economic principles
thats fair
against what temptation
do you like science
mhm fair enough i love science and i love discovering things but also i know i probably wont be able to devote my whole life to one thing
the tradeoff i make is being able to try many things instead of being very good at one me intense at what lol
i try
but i dont suceed i dont think ill suceed
i mean we only have so much energy right if you devote all of it to two things you probably wont do as well as if you devote all of it to one
i know im talking about objectively being better and what youre saying is sort of the menyality i adopt i dont need to be better than everyone else to be happy
yeah
i guess thats one way to see it haha i think its hard to be a good doctor and a good scientist just because you cant devote as much time to research
i guess unless you become a pi thats true thats what im interested in the interdisciplinary aspect of everything thats what drew me into health econ
haha thanks frank i appreciate it i did choose my position rather strategically just that i realize i need to try much harder than ie xpected lol
true true lol i run the risk of blindly working hard though this is my warning to anyone who believes hard work is the only way to success
but anyway
i mean game design and science dont have to be two separate paths right
theres certainly a lot of science education but also programs and predictions things like polyphens
ooooh you have my full attention not that you didnt beforebut more than full attnetion
interesting i mean this is kind of the concept behind eleanring right which is what im doing
in fact one of the modules im making is kind of like a game so you have trying to use your clinical reasoning to maximize your score
weve touched on a fascinating topic ive been thinking about there is no doubt that elearning and virtual environments can teach in an efficient way
yes ive discussed with multiple people the role of ai in medicine i am of the opinion that medicine is 40 human interaction if not more which is what ai cannot replace
i think for pathology and radiology maybe
thats true i guess
oh thats cool in the division of clinical genetics i think virtual apps are only meant to complement but not replace
i think medical schools can use more virtual apps
when we were taught how to assess a patient for volume status and hyponatremiahypernatremia the flow charts were confusing as hell
in what way
lol well we have emotions for things like r2d2 and cp3o i think but i think its different im talking about reciprocation have you ever watched her
its a movie
whaaaat i think youll like the premise basically its siri but next level
el oh el theres another show called black mirror one of the episodes takes hers premise to a higher level in that they implant the ai into a physical robot that looks human but the same argument applies
i recommend watching the trailer no the assistant talks like a real human its like youre on the phone 247 with your secretary who tells jokes tells jokes and talks like a friendpartner
haha
oh okay
nah you can program it with emotions you can simulate it and im sure someone will try but im just saying theres something about who we are that makes it impossible to fully replace the human aspect
i will put it on my list
haha i never tried video games so ill take your words for it
sounds good these are things i actually care about lol good luck with your abstract ill see you around
httpswwweconomistcomnewsleaders21725313howsciencelearningcangetbestoutedtechtogethertechnologyandteacherscan look what i found on the economist this week
what i personally have noticed with learning softwares  or just softwares that are supposed to make you more efficient  is that sometimes the softwares tell the user how to learn instead of the user picking the right functions to suit their needs
haha okay
kk this is an ongoing discussion no rush
of course you
good
haha
yup not much changes tho lol
i hope to but we will see i started doing a different kind of modules now and its like our graphic design lol
pure graphic in the sense im trying to make things look pretty and design in an intuitive way
the material is genetic like how to take a history
nah not like a glorified ppt when i have access to my computer tmrw ill send you a video its like one of those course modules that have quiz embedded
yes im trying to design it in such a way that the info can be retained better but i realize that this is a science in itself that i havent paid enough attention to
yeah not just a block of text
the thing is the silly designs and not so textboo layout actually help with learning but it makes it look less professional and true less authoritative therefore
oh
yeah i personally find the best way for me to learn is if someone speak to me and then show me and then let me do it especially in medicine
which is why i find a lecture on how to do a tracheostomy just simply didnt make sense
yeah but resource constraint what can you do vr maybe
mhm brb walking in the rain
im sure there is someone or even just patient simulation we have this model called harvey that can simulate all kinds of heart sounds but they are very exoensive
i dont know i just know they are expensive and in short supply
partly because its a niche market so each model has a high cost
buying it is expensive and running it is also expensive apparently  i dondontw the details man the more i talk about these things the more i realize the future of medicine is not in medicine
system design and renovation thats the future
i may have to ditch you for two hours lol going rock climbing
will follow up this is when i usually go unwind from the day
lol ripped a chunk of my skin off judt another day at the rock gym
not everyday i dont go everyday and not always this severe lol my callouses definitely get worse every time
where do you live
true north climbing
according to google yes
wow they even have free technique lessons
interesting i get anxious if i do that only recently tho
kk
i have case conference on thursdays whats going on today
sounds useful lemme know how it is lol
yeah its also so common where do you live again north york
oh lol my friend and i are going to dim sum in markham and two people arent enough to eat a variety but its okay we are trying something else instead
ooooh he is right its the 4th today httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvx0mgoosplu 4minute 44seconds very interesting
ooh which book
good night
tina ó° oops very interesting i guess based on what i know of stanley i spent be surprised of his choice can you guess what camp i am i think its fairly obvious
what no what makes you think i am i am a firm believer of the meir of hard work merit
however i think the two theories are over simplifying a bit theres intelligenceability which i think its malleable theres also inherited smartness for a lack of better term
consider smartness as goes fast you acquire your intelligence no its not you can be part of both vamos camps
it may be a bit of both its hard to tease apart family influence and inborn gift
well our perception of others reflects how we think and what we do right p whats stanleys argument for entity theory against ours
thats fair but do the predictions off having an entity money apply to him as well the performance vs mastery attitude towards adversaries
and the goal is to prove someone is smart
right he did express that
not reach it ever or just too hard
haha okay stanley has been pretty open with me but not on this topic yet lol you know now i think of it my family is a bit of both i am the in between camp really
my mother was considered smart she didnt have to work to hard throughout all these years of school and always top of the class but if i work hard i can do just as well
yeah theres a guy in our class who is probably universally considered smart i was struggling with the class materials cuz they were foreign to me so i asked him for advice
yeah that makes it hard to apply seeing how things are connected makes learning more interesting but also more efficient
yes you are certainly not alone i know many to kind of just work hard but not paying attention to how they work in fact my closest undergrad friend was like that
haha
fair i guess i just got very lucky and had great parents lol
the most common comment about intelligence i hear from them is how smart or stupid a method is not necessary a person and i often catch myself saying there must be a smarter way of doing this
yes lol my dad discourages me from working hard hes like youre a workaholic why does it matter so much to you coming from the most hardworking person i know
maybe haha
lol mahjong you guys that play that im in windsor actually
going back to toronto tonight
nope getting chores done and getting work doneð
well not for the work part i had to come back here anyway before i fly off to china but while im here in my comfortable aparmtnet i might as well do other things that ive been putting off
i havent started yetð i only came back yesterday though
had an enjoyable weekend you must think im crazy sometimes i wonder that too why do i do things
other people wont do
i came back to windsor partially because i feel like i need my space and working on weekend is foreign to most of my friends lol
haha good to know im not alone in what i choose to do with my free time
yeah i think most people plan social life aaround work like nonwork hours are for social life and working i think i plan my work around my social life nonsocial lifenotadventure time is workreading time lol
thanks enjoy your time with stanley
hm i never thought of it as a macro or micro level but interesting that you brought up learning motivation again because i was listening to an audiobook while driving that talked about self motivation
the book discussed the importance of taking control haha it was not intentional
i appreciate that haha random thoughts are always welcomed because i usually have lots of random thoughts lol
kewl i did hope you had a good time with stanley have a good night
where are you printing your poster
okay
okay i used to print at utposter i think ill just do the same
utposter epends on the lab mine is most likely not covered it definitely will not be covered for me actually
meh i expected that
i dont have to do a poster i dont think
i should though
nah just gonna go for practice and for looking at other peoples posters lol
same just let me out of here
lol i still have stuff i ahve to do ugh
fixing up thing
yes but stuff i no longer want to do i feel so donel ol
sunday
i thought you guys were planning it i mean stanley is the one who has to travel
but i guess knowing him hes not one to initiate anything
lol today it is after work im going climbing at 830
making my poster where is stanley
lemme talk to my supervisor and ill have a better idea
okay how does 5 sound i should get this done before leaving
jimmys btw how big is your title font
on gerrard near timmys
actually lets just meet at food society its close yes
that sounds good too theres bubble republic on bay
no thats bubble tease bubble republic is at the north east corner of bay and edward
so like two minutes from pgcrl
cool thanks see you soon
the poster is done omg um how big is the file size of your poster mine is only 11mb im a little concerned
hm okay my poster last year is 17mb
im just worried about photo resolution lol whatever its okay
yeah its just a bunch of screenshots well find out lol
hi lol i was at a meeting about to meet a friend
later today except you probably wont be bored by then anymore lol
i was bored earlier today boredom is an interesting topic lets explore that another time
yes pretty much i love talking i thought i made that clear yesterday
frankly i was borderline depressed this morning so
sorry to hear that glad you seem better now yes id love to
i was serious about it sorry i was out with friends for four hours man i cant believe it
nah im glad i still have enough to tell my friends about for that long because with some people the friendship just deteriorates after a while
im the kind of person who is willing to invest so much into a friendship as long as the person is willing to reciprocate to some extent
in what way
nope i agree with you and thats something i learned over the year and i cant demand everyone to be like me
yeah i did change my strategy half way through the year it worked out better
its actually a leadership skill i realized that its something im decently good at so ill continue trying
i was complaining to stanley because i feel that he understands and so do you
i really appreciate it thank you for your advice honestly i think most of my friends can be a little more frank p pun intended
i was just telling my friend that many people i know are afraid of being vulnerable and transparent about themselves yet they crave a deep connection
yeah being open to people who are different from me has been the single most valuable skill i leanred all year
thank you  thats incredibly flattering and it means a lot frank
thats wonderful that is also an incredible skill that you feel comfortable speaking your mind the world could use more of that lol
yes
of course i remember clearly our discussion what about it
yes if you reduce things to physiology i guess for me i am an idealistic person and i believe that we derive values from human experience and happiness but the main character chose to leave that world
well thats why a lot of people do drugs right for me to feel high about life is through actual human experience while for drug addicts it is through manipulation of the human brain
wait what did you want from me
haha so you were testing me
i feel honored p anyway since we are done with this topi if youre interested still we can go back to our earlier tangent about boredom and depression
kewl im already in bed lol good night
yo have you prepared a speech for your poster yet
fair im trying but i have zero motivation lol
its not for the prize being able to present a poster is a skill i should have
from past experience not really lol i can but it wont be most efficient
as in i need to think about the angleperspective i choose to present obviously im not going to readrecite from a scriot
yeah i also need to do more readings and pitch the project more like a research project
kewl mine is ready for pick up apparently d
you submit online
um i submit in pdf they will create a proof for you to approve and you have to confirm you want to print then they will print for you
yes
yes oops i forgot to put the sickkids logo on my poster lol awks
cash
pay at pick up if you have a lab credit card bring that with yoy
yeah now i feel bored
i have things i should be doing but i dont want to do them yeah
fix up some little things in my modules almost done but just too lazy to do more finish my transition report almost done too
basically transitioning my project back to my supervisor write up all the resources organize my g drive folder etc so she can find things later on
fair
sounds like my project last summer
tell me about it
im not sure if im bored or i just dont have motivation i think its more the latte rlol
i guess i can always read other things but have no drive lol
nah like nonwork related lol
i am interested in many things lol
like i mentioned yesterday i was borderline depressed and sometimes that is mixed up with boredom not having anythign to do and not wanting to do things are very different and ive been somewhere in between
yeah usually sitting in my office
i was just on youtube my solution has always been try to actually do something such as sweeping the floor its like youre in a valley and you gotta just pull yourself out
pretty much lol
mmm what books what game dev project
his writing feels pretty modern lol
trolling the player yes on liberty
ah his writing is clear and concise at least i find it so httpwwwgutenbergorgfiles3490134901h34901hhtm
i am generally interested in understanding the foundation of western society and john stuart mill is an important figure lol i also do tend to read a lot of classical work i have a quesiton
like i said i tend to find a lot of things interesting and end up reading a lot of random things is that a good or a bad thing
but at the same time i get heavily distracted and sometimes unable to focus on one thought
i think so for example its the process of internalizing information that i often ignore
i have a friend to whom i send a lot of interesting articles and he always asks me to summarize it into three major points and i struggle with that yeah
no but if you read an opinion article but not able to explain the authors opinion what is the point of reading it really
i guess haha or just come up with a strategy that maximize efficiency
active reading is a skill
i want to be more productive p
especially that i have interests in so many fields
nah thats not why i think active reading is more important nowadays given the advance of technology
for com sci probably not for ethical problems or philosophical inquiries etc though i struggle to grasp enough of a specific topic to form a satisfactory opinion
yeah im thinking that i should start writing it will force me to improve reading and writing skills which are on the top of my priority list
haha thanks and this just demonstrates to you a normal day inside my head its maddening sometimes really
but its not about information though its about ideas
information is memorizing martin luther kings entire speech idea is about his view on racism and its effect on the subsequent antiracism movement and its lingering effect to this day
sure ideas cant exist independent of facts and information but ideas help me see the world better and generate more ideas
lol i guess thats one explanation
to some extents you build you problem solving ideas on previous ideas you look at how other solves it and adapt it
true thats medicine but i guess i have a strong interest in health policy which is a lot of philosophy ethics and sociology there are a lot of writings out there that i think are complete bullshit
you think so not for me lol we havent even gone into a debate yet
my honour lol i like exploring these topics i guess although i wonder if people ever get annoyed
i understand sometimes that we all need some mindless chats sometimes
this summer it has been pretty low given the people i talk to regularly id say 30 for this summer during school year its more like 6070
nah just people i met this summer you stanley close high school friends
yeah i understand i get tired too lol i just go through phases
im good for the day i think lol
i managed to get myself to do something useful so thats good thanks for the chat lol
what are you gonna do now
correct im reading toronto notes
cool cool ttyl are you in the morning or afternoon session
when are you going
okay
l ill come join not in the mood for any work anyway
kewl where r u yo
were r u
im heading there too
nope still here leaving tmrw
likewise for sure
why did they do that lol
i feel that you require more than a bit of coding to start a company
hm fair
decent im stuck in alaska right now also debating if i should learn some basic coding its becoming clear to me this language is a must and why are you awake at this ungodly hour
good to know nope completely unplanned plane has problems
i wish lol i dont think theyd let us
even though i technically can wander in zus us
oh well too bad polar bears dont wander around in airports would love to see one
yeaaaa all the fjords
mhm all the huskies too
i feel you lol
shanghai has so much wealth now it feels so foreign sometimes
a minority but a bigger and more visible minority
eh kinda like they are probably 10mil  usd worth
you see them in toronto yes not more in percentage in shanghai but def more in absolute nimebr
wealth gap is real
ohi lied then lol i found them easier than other textbooks ive read
which one did you reaf
i find on liberty to be pretty straightforward ah didnt try that but i want to read it
yeah i see
haha yeah it sounds relevant i have not
nope bch210 and i gtfo
nah i didnt take the mol gen major i did genome bio jointly offered by csb eeb mgy a lot less strict on rrqs reqs
yes i did say that i decided mol gen is the coolest of the three and i worked at two mol gen labs
yup mol gen profs also do badass research its one of the stronger research department imo mol gen biochem and lmp eeb is not bad but only a few hot shots
lol now you know how about benting and best
do you feel the ut pride now

oh
i know what you mean i agree but i guess im glad the advertisement brings in talents
hahaha research discoveries are rarely intentional
lol fire away anyway if youd like im waitinin line for us custom clearance
yes but its still a better bet to fund labs who know what they are doing lol
we had a lecture on being a good doctor today the lecture itself was poorly delivered but i think you wouldve liked the materials
he didnt really give an answer but he talked about some tools specifically character vs personality development resume vs eulogy building being good vs doing good
yeah that was the weird part about it
kk
oh thats not that important just weird to talk about it in this setting but the point is that
this is something ive thought about quite a lot and intensified during medical school  the quest to improve our resume all throughout undergrad i keep hearing sales pitch like this is little commitment and looks great on a resume
anyway the conclusion for my rant is that it was somewhat reassuring to know that character building is important and that having integrity and a strong moral compass does help you be a good doctor but it also confirmed my realization that i need to create the image too
i guess i dont know towards the end of last year it actually kind of stressed me out i feel a lot better now and much better adjusted but i realized its an unfortunate reality i have to face
haha v true my point for bringing this up is that its glad to see character development is still very much an important aspect although its like hey you should be a good doctor by being a good person
safe trip home nice chatting
yeah whats up havent talked to him in a while though
hm i can try ill let you know how it goes
dont thank me yet no guarantee lol
its okay things going really fast
yeah i bit overwhelming tbh not the curriculum though materials are easy its the other obligations and the forever fear that im not doing enough lol
and the fear that im doing too much lol
always in a state of trying to figure out what i should be focusing on stretching oneself too thin
yeah ive been thinking about that
but the thing is the professional landscape has changed  a lot so unless i talk to residents and there isnt any resident of the type i want to talk to
yeah we had a career night but most physicians are like 20 years into their practice and the professional landscape has changed a lot
yes dont have many of these though haha im finding my way just slowly
windsor is tough cuz its a very small campus frank the biggest problem is that i dont know what i want lol
both
publication global health research etc what exactly do i waant to focus on im ambivalent
its not the technical knowledge part im concerned about its things like publications and conferences and scholarships and awards the stupid things that you need to be a competitive candidate for residency matching
yeah i dont know im going through a career planning struggling planning for med school wasnt as bad because i just needed the grade and mcat but residency matching and long term career are much more serious
i need an abstract to attend conference and my rsearch so far are all basic sciences that take years to publish i think im gonna look into faster publication opportunities but i kind of hate that
the shortest route to success isnt necessarily the one i prefer but i learned to accept that the world doesnt evolve around me so lol we will always be on the grind frank
haha hows school enough talk about me and thanks for listening
its also a networking opportunity i have reservation about networking events in windsor because i dont find them helpful maybe hackathons are helpful
talking to person also gives you feedbacks right equivalents would be working on a guideline or a clinical research project yourself
exactly so you want to collaborate you should try a game jam there are lots of those its still game development and forces you to think on your feet
although youll be dying on monday severe sleep deprivation
lol mine is not as severe as some stanley would know better p i dont pull all nighters at least im just chronically fatigue
not surprised and some acid did you hear about the lsd microdosing in silicon valley
many its a culture ill send you the article i read later today
you found it
the former more likely really
well this is sillicon valley we are talking about pressure to perform is real
haha that means youre trying hard yeah drug addiction is a problem in medicine too
hi busy but good you
whaaaar what prompted this thought
such as
welcome to my med school life lol did you feel that way in undergrad though
oh shoot i need to go
message me as you wish ill respond later
hi
waiting for my volleyball game not motivated to do anything productive lol
im not good at it i can serve i can hit a ball
played a little in middle school and just started playing again this past year its a rec team pretty chill
recreational so we are not the competitive team
nope not at all
theres one or two guys on our team who can spike the other teams are also mostly beginners and some good players like i cnat return a spike or block one so i usually just set for my teammates
eh i guess everyone has to serve
i set because i cant do anything else lol
lol nope lol ive only watcheddeathnotes and case closed a little bit of fullmetal alchemist
hahaha i can imagine
as with everything
um does it exist
 itll have to be complemented by in person teaching i mean with the vc system we might as well watch lectures online
videoconferencing so its like a big skype session with the london campus
yes for clinical skills at least
well its in person teaching but not in classroom like teaching clinical skills interviewing
a medical degree also requires interactions and discussions among students which can theoretically be hosted on skype session but in person is much better good thought though maybe you can replace parts of it
yes and no its kind of nice to have a physician that mixes theoretical teaching with his clinical experience you could read about them online but the instant communication is pretty invaluable
theres not as much pressure for med school there are only a selected few topics that get tested so if you really want to do well on the test you can choose to study high yield
first year many people still study for the sake of the exam this year its much less so but id rather learn and get assessed in a clinical setting than getting assessed on a computer
what do you mean purely for the knowledge
lol well thats been my strategy this year i know if i study i wont fail so i dont care as much about my grades anymore
there are at least a few people in the class who are like that
some other people absorb everything because they probably dont bother differentiating in some sense its kind of snobby of me to think that i know whats important but certain things just dont seem to offer me any immediate benefit
it makes my life a lot easier lol
yeah i guess probably not lol itd be a continuation of undergrad my undergrad wasnt too bad there were maybe one or two courses i really hated studying for but most of them had itneresting enough materials
i can imagine your undergrad exams must be brutal
thatâs true iâm glad to hear that
its tough in undergrad
lol do they tell you what they get i didnt know what my friends grades were we didnt talk about it
i see
procrastinating what
how does the pressure to get grades make you procrastinate i thought itâd make you work harder lol
interesting iâm afraid i canât relate lol but that must be frustrating i personally donât like studying things over and over again so i force myself to pay attention in class the trick is not to cram
hi sorry was playing chalk vball we lost informatively unfortunately sorry canât type my arms are shaky still lol
lol when you probably shouldâve beenstudying
lol good for you hi im gonna figure out a way to get him to talk to you directly but this is what he said so far oh and he recommended the website stack overflow
nah not deep stuff just hypothetical awkwardness seems like hes not awkward about it at all so its cool
its saturday tmrw wtf but okay best of luck
hey iâm in ottawa this weekend
conference
global health conference
nope literally just going to listen to other people lol
ðð not sure what the schedule is like for conference will let you know
itâs ending soon sorry didnât message you earlier i have to leave right after to where iâm staying may not be able to see you today
hahaha
howâs your weekend with this dreary wesrher
in orleans with a friend
relaxing is good you need it every now and then i can really take a weekend off right now lol hmmm iâll most likely be in windsor if i go to london iâll let you know
but good for you youâre getting on the hackathon train p
d
oooh
are you going to prepare anything for it
oh okay
perfect now you can go shoot and say thatâs for work
even just phone cameras are a good place to start and look at other peopleâs photos
nope but i watched a lot of online videos
def lots of youtube videos on photography
what does a lighting software look like what kind of features and functions what does it do
oh okay i always bought game development starts from like coding lol
mmm yeah photography is like 50 lighting
lots of health financing stuff v interesting
randomized controlled trials in subsidizing products implementation of universal health care
yeah but this is a global health conference itâs about hc elsewhere
yeah some research is so narrow though like looking at one single indicator
lol yeah
yeah it was a fun experience just sucks i was sick
i was sick before and it got worse sleep deprivation too lol
oh well i still had a great time and i tested my limit lol
mhm i find classes okay  not too hard to deal with but i didnât want to go shopping or sightseeing etc thank goodness i went with friends so they dragged me around lol
haha very probably would not have gone to the conference alone def would not
one from high school but studying law in ottawa the rest are all from western we had a big group that went to ottawa together for the conference
decent busy but not too stressful hbu
oooh
how did it go
really
cute pocket pup btw
good idea
well yes technologies are successful because of their addictive nature but the addictive nature could be used for good or bad
good timing you messaged me about this today because we talked about e health in class today i had very similar thoughts during the lecture
2 why havenât we used apps more to encourage patient empowerment such as using apps to encourage better tracking of caloric intake or blood pressure or glucose etc 3 regulation is going to be so hard
iâm about to fall asleep been awake since 6 but this is very interestingcomplete your thoughts and iâll catch up tmrw
hi sorry for the late response
nope did you think you saw me
ahaha i was in toronto
did you say hi and then got a weird look
haha well iâm glad you asked at least how are things
this week has been difficult for me to be motivated in any way lol no exams this week than goodness
mid january
nah itâs block system we have 6 week blocks after every few blocks  we get an exam week
yup
lol we will see thatâs a huge assumption
i hope si
iâve actually been thinking about it i should be studying right now but instead iâm just fixed to the couch and i donât know why itâs almost like depression but itâs not i know iâm not depressed
yeah i think itâs honestly just burnout
iâve stretched myself thin for sure but i didnât know what my limit was for the past two weeks iâm constantly forcing myself to be productive
and forgot i need mental breaks
yeah pretty much
yup lol thank goodness only the last week of school i wouldnât know how to beat myself for longer
i plan on it
but just review stuff nothing mandatory
yup so this winter break lol
was thinking about messaging you today actually but at a friends house today iâll message you later
hi i relaxed a bit too much last nighthad some wine and spent most of today recovering from my mistake lol
no class today haha iâm responsiblesomewhat i didnât know you started internship whatâs it about
still sounds like a good start  no we did not chat i barely communicated with anyone cuz i was in australia so the time zone made it difficult to talk to people i went to hang out with my parents basically slept ate and watched tv lol very much unlike the usual me but it was beautiful how about you
that sounds infinitely more productive and fulfilling lol yes my parents moved there they are in melbourne now did you make a game or not sure what game development exactly means
mmmm either way seems like a win what type of game isnit
mmm that sounds like a pretty dynamic interesting premise and pretty much lolalso just everyone in china wants to leave
it is
for my parents china still has more opportunities i think but socially its a bit unstable i dont really know why they wanted to move tbh
it was cool for melbourne but definitely not complaining it was low 20s sometimes in the 30s celsius range above zero of course ahaha
how long is your internship
i mean youre sitll in internship our clerkship is similar in the sense we go from speciality to speciality to get exposure
mmmm i went backwards lol i ruled out surgery but iâm no longer sure about that
haha lifestyle mostly and the idea that you may do the surgery over and over again i wasnât sure if iâd be okay taking out six gallbladders a day and thatâs all i do
hi i just woke up so yes i basically passed out lol
bothmost likely i donât know iâve been sleep deprived for a while busy day today iâll catch you later enjoy your weekend
hey sorry iâve been mia how was your weekend
ahahaha heâs a good writer from my impression i havenât actually caught up with him in a while maybe i should how are you doing though not just work wise
feeling any more secure about com sci
whatâs it called
iâm tempted to say no
because our brain is not predictable by virtue of probability
fair but ai can influence how we think because we are psychologically maniputable yes i just invented the word
that also works
two l
overall okay january is always a difficult one weather is shitty and this is when most of my reflections happen lol and thatâs not usually a very pleasant process a very necessary tho
just reflecting on past year where i am now and where i want to be and setting goals
not diligent itâs a natural thing i naturally do it sometimes i wish i didnât lol um i finish half of them usually but some of the goals are more of a means to an end
i read 12 books goal was 5 lol  bit unfair because my bar was so low
um i made progress on climbing also literally i had one goal âmake a friendâ i think i achieved that
i mean you are a friend right haha p
thatâs fair itâs just easy to make year long goal but my reading goal ended up being one book per month so itâs really multiple short term goals
haha i accept all criticism
yup same with climbing i donât know doing things and achieving small things make me feel alive but i think this year will be more career focused soyeah some long term strategies are necessary
itâs our residency matching program donât tell stanley cuz heâll be like wtf tina why
yeah i was just discussing this in the morning the balancedifference between gratitude about what you have and striving for what you want
yeah
do you have goodreads
itâs a platform like facebook
you can mark books to read and read other peopleâs reviews thatâs okay
lemme find it you need to sign up you can do so via fb though
mmm maybe i dont remember in 2017 i read wait stories of your life is 2018
oh
2016 i didnt count i read in bouts usually ill do like two three books at a time then i dont touch anything for a while so having a monthly goal is actually nice
lol that sounds like a textbook
thats flattering lol but im not that well read tbh i dont remember alot of things i read but interesting education is an interesting topic will take a look what else do you read other than com sci stuff
hha thatâs one productive way to read at least you got something out of it is that a new book by him i really like his writing
hehe nice oh i have something i want to share
ive been watching a lot of ted talks lately inspirational ones feel good ones etc etc
have you come across any of angela duckworths work on grit and its contribution to peoples scuess
so she has one ted talk thats relatively short and one long one at talks at google basically she said what helps people succeed is not iq or intelligence but grit and grit isnt merely perserverance
also add passion to that mix i forgot
i either dont have enough perserverence or i dont deliberately practise enough what i dont lack is passion lol i love what i do
nah i have time im just not focused i have short attention span tbh ill spend one week intensively on one thing and the next week im distracted by something else
well creativity is spur of the moment but to realize it requires work if itâs not carried out an idea is just an idea
yeah i have no lack of idea xd i get discouraged too easily though
well i have photo project ideas then im like thats a lot of work i dont know how to solve problem a or problem b ill think about it later then it never happens
yeah good point kk
very true im setting monthly goal right now i think being able to consistently think about something over a long period of time is a habit and it takes a while for a habit to form
haha you deserve a break sounds like yove worked a lot on it
tina ó° thats awesome rooting for you
nice catching up with you too imma do some leisure reading before my new block starts will do gives me some motivation hehe
did you add me on goodreads
i wonder if its a complete coincidence that someone names frank added me
but it says youre in montreal so i was confused stevejobsfangay
interesting name
oh youre living in the quebec part of ottaw
136 books but thats over like last 10 years is that a lot someone i know read 70 books in one year
no lol maybe my high school friend she reads so fast
lol i guess its all relative i have very wellread friends i guess
heh yeah
nah that was high school i never changed the location
haha its not jsut about quantity right i dont remember a lot of things i read so number is just a number
if you have better use of your time you dont have to read really but its interesting to hear what other peeople have to say in an eloquent way
mm i guess thats true i also like to see peoples writing style hoping that i could write better one day
too many things to improve haha
thatâs an awfully romantic idea but yes
good for you ahaha
good night i correct myself  there are people in my class who study way harder makes me feel ashamed but also glad lol i donât ever want to study that much holy crap
yes i am i just remember telling you that i work hard but then i realize thatâs a lie
ahahaha wow itâs really been that long eh
i asked my friend how many times he goes over a lecture he countedseven
thatâs not including in lecture
so when he does go to lectures itâs like 8 he studies throughout the block which i try to do but not very consistently
depends on what you want out of it
i donât know sense of reassurance probably which is hard to get in medicine because you never feel like you know enough
nah not 4 x it will pay off next year iâll probably need to study this summer so i am prepared for clerkship
lol you can ask stanley i stopped looking from a third person perspective now itâs easier just to do what needs to be done
well yes
but you can also try to convince yourself itâs for something else or i try to
because thatâs whatâs more important
hahaha
itâs not so bad really it is to some extent but at the end of the day i survive and i feel good about it
yeah haha i guess thrive not survive
mmm yes and no ultimately itâs up to the researcher to decide how credible other peopleâs findings are because thereâs a lot of bad research out there and contradicting evidence
there is a lot of basic info we need yes like troubleshooting an experiment
good luck
haha no worries i do take care of myself probably spend too much time on that
lol no seriously though i spend a lot of time on my hobbies and sleeping and health and exercise thatâs why iâm always busy but not usually stressed
lol i could do more volunteering something thats not just about me
thinking about it not set plan for summer but already many ideas
yes
im debating travelling is nice but there are other things important for my future i dont get travel fomo anymore i used to i do what i want before i die thank you very much
yeah so i dont know i guess it just depends on what i feel ismore important
hahaha
holy crap you did not tell me you applied to japan but thatâs amazing for how long
yeah of course
as you should be  iâm excited for you too
gotta keep me posted on all your adventures when iâm dying in clerkship lol live vicariously through you
yes please for real tho i donât hate you so itâs okay you can be happy
thatâs fair i guess prewarninf if i say i hate you i mean so affectionately
iâll try to stay alive to remind you of that haha
haha why do people bond over miseries but not happiness
lol no just in general everyone is like that i feel a tendency towards it
true i also been pondering lately about jealousy
jealousy stems from wants you want something and you donât have it it also stems from a comparison with another person you donât have it but someone else does
i havenât been troubled really by jealousy in the past and iâm trying to figure out why do i simply not want that much or do i simply not compare with others
i also watch my dad being haunted by his ambitions that he canât fulfill yet my mom was never jealous of anything lol genetically ð
i donât know i realized i want things and i donât have them and other people are ahead and i genuinely like them and want to learn from them but it also induces a sadness i didnât have before
i imagine what i want and then i believe it and then i realize i havenât even tried lol i need constant reality check
oh i do all the time lol
hehe i can see that but what motivates improvement it seems you need miseries
i guess iâm always too happy to feel miserable enough i mean both can be motivations but miseries is much more effective
i know itâs bad for mental health but the few times i improved faster than i expected were when i was miserable lol i guess persistence is the key
lol please remind me of my miseries every now and then
i want to go back to toronto for residency lol itâs not really a misery but more of a goal
just need to remind myself every now and then i havenât achieved it yet
i think about it and feel sad and then i just forget about it happy tina goes this is not fun to think about imma go climb
wherever takes me lol mac is my second choice one sec iâm driving home
i was at the gym lol
nah treadmill and some squats just relaxing stuff but yeah i feel like i need to change my mindset i donât know whatâs right anymore i guess they donât necessarily conflict
being good at something instead of something to put on resume i donât know iâm still sorting things out i think i dabble too much want to do too many things you canât have it all
i think just in general most people canât be good at everything
some people maybe but iâm most people
frank you make me cru cry
almost literally but not quite ahahaha
reflections are important and they are usually painful so yeah also i just had an idea while doing dishes
iâm interested in writing a narrative medicine piece ahaha iâm interested in everything what did i say
the title will be lost in translation
about healthcare across two languages i feel like someone might have done this alreay
iâll explain later more about my healthcare experience in both systems as a patient and now as a future provider and the realizaiton that even though language may be a barrier ultimately the common language in medicine is compassion
yeah i need to write it though idea is just an idea without execution
mmm im going to take the next month to write it
ask me again in two weeks lol i need to get my butt moving
eh right havent talked to him in ages wonder how he is he has very different writing style thou
what no oh right he told me
i didnt see on facebook tho
yeah i saw now
ahahaha
i think he likes it just that he never gave writing a try
haha okay whenever youre ready imma go do dishes
what am i supposed to figure out like what happened
ah okay although i am confused kayla is the exgf doug is a friend of kyle but kyle is also hisboyfriend
and who killed naomi kyle
ah so doug was worried that kyle was possessed when he was talking to kayla and realized kyle was possessed when he talked to parkinson
and kyle was the one messaging naomi as doug
or was doug just too late to get in touch with naomi kyle was already there to kill her
thats a pretty fun stry now ill have nightmares thank you very much
i can see stanley being like that you guys are cute i need to read more narrative writings first though gotta do some research writing is another thing ive struggled with since high school
sorry when i mean narrative writing i dont mean a fictional story more like an opinion piece with a real story
a real story narrative medicine is about telling a true story exploring the humanity side of medicine
the effective practice of medicine requires narrative competence that is the ability to acknowledge absorb interpret and act on the stories and plights of others medicine practiced with narrative competence called narrative medicine is proposed as a model for humane and effective medical practice
good night
lol
not yet
haha hi thanks  we were planning on celebrating chinese new year and valentines day was the only day that worked and coincidental enough all the guys were single so its not like they had any other plans lol
 where is it good luck
ah nice
ahahaha actually did stanley say that i didnât think too much of it lol
if that were the case iâm glad i could be of help xd
iâll take the compliment regardless hehe how was your valentineâs day
how lovely how did your hackathon go
hahahaha yeah went to the rom for some exhibits went out for brunch and pastries went climbing etc relaxing weekend and now im paying for all that relaxation lol
no no as in now im paying for my time off to catch up on school because im bhind
lol
yeah this weekend was my relaxation now work for 12 days its relaly not so bad but i guess its so daunting that you think its bad
i mean i need to study over the weekend so imma treat it like a work day
hehe thats okay i just need some mood adjustment this weather really isnt helping
yeah i guess its at least warm studying time oh well
just a thought today multiple people around me speak of having life all figured out
but i wonder if thats actually achievable i feel like first step of figuring life out is to recognize taht you cant
hm theres just no end point someone in my class told me i look like i have my life all figured out im like lol thats so not true but i guess i seem more okay with it
nope def not ahaha
merp depends on your perspective i guess today im feeling particularly optimistic about not knowing where im going
good things or bad things such is life oh have you ever readwatched david foster wallaces commencement speech
httpbulletinarchivekenyonedux4280html incredible read
haha no worries just wanted to share
its refreshing and humbling ive been telling myself a lot this is water mostly during scenarios like he described  bad road condition long lines at grocery stores etc
no but its just frustrating espeically when you have a med school schedule and you have to get to places fast
i know and his commecement helps but thats just one part of it
well the other part is that idea of observing the world from a third person perspective
depends on your definition of objective but from a perspective from your usual default one yes
not all of it was surprising but it was very well put and i think it goes beyond what i already know
its much more than thinking in terms of other peoples shoes
just gathering my thoughts while studying for anatomy bear with me
the first part of the speech is about thinking from other peoples perspectives etc
itâs well written and candid and good reminder every now and then when iâm stressed gives me a more appreciative attitude also he killed him self not long after this speech sadly
i know he was such an amazing individual makes it all the more invaluable
seen a little bit and stopped tarantino is too violent for me
iâll read a review instead of watching the movie
haha thank you  took me a while too iâm glad you resonate with it
yeah this year has been a lot of reflections actually more like since i got into med school
yeah itâs fun
lol not everyone
some of my classmates
they feel far removed from their feelings have a hard time verbalizing it
can you live in a state of knowing what is wrong and still doing it
i should use diffferent terminologies as in you know why you feel a certain way and you know why itâs wrong or terrible for you but you just choose to think about it anyway
sometimes i dont think its a hoice choice but i see your point
fair
um define expert
mmm careerwise hoping to be interdisciplinary so maybe health economics although id probalby need another degree hobbywise probably photography or piano but not both
economics that deals with healthcare and healthy behaviours etc  im more interested in healthcare system so more health financing i guess why you ask
one of my major conclusions from my twomonth reflection was that you cant have it all sofind your priority
try your best at what youre doing keep your eyes open for opportunities but if you keep focusing on what you could theoretically do youll have a hard time getting better at what you are already doing time
ive thought about doing many things at a time and ive tried didnt work as well as i wanted
i mean you can get better by doing that but it will take much longer if you dont use it you lost it
lose i notice it significantly with my piano playing even just taking two weeks off ive regressed let alone making progress same with climbing but i guess it depends on what you want to do
you can build your different fields on top of each other kind of waht my dad did  spent 10ish years doing financial analysis 5 years doing management and then got a job that uses both skills
fair although with things like comp sci even if you dont lose the skills you already have the field evolves so quickly you may fall behind i talekd to my pi about this
yeah these are more like skills than a field i like being able to do things instead of just thinking which sometimes makes me quesiton if i should do surgery instead lol i like procedures
maybe
eh what do you mean
it is but so are some nonsurgical fields its competitive simply because there are fewer surgeons than there are family docs or internists and you do need to think in surgery but its different types of thinking
he wants family medicine btw
the specialties do not necessarily correlate with competency not in a gradesense they differ in the type of competency and maybe the softer qualities that befit each specialties
surgeons do get respected more though simply because they are surgeons
but i personally treat them all the same tbh its more about how well they do their job than what their job is granted each patient has slightly different anamoty its not like youre an assembly line worker
eh kind of im not familiar with other ones but id imagine ortho would be lots of hip replacement knee replacement internal fixation for fractures etc
trauma surgery is an subspecialty of gen srug haha so even more years of training oh well
simulators exist
they are just really expensive to train on there are systems similar to what star trek has minus all the fancy stuff if you can make cheaper simulators thatd be great
i dont know ive never used one or seen one so i cant tell you much lol i was thinking the other day because the starting point is no longer about us
nothing wrong intrinsically its just dangerous at least for me
relating to david foster wallaces speech and from experience watching my father struggle with his greed
he never truly felt like he had enough
hes relentless in his pursuit but hes just unhappy
its easier said than done lol if it were that easy then the world would be a very different place right now
nothing specific but like if i could make more money i could buy that house in melbounre if i could make more money i could do insert something else wealth is limitless and you can always gain more
lol no i know hes not
nah he knows why hes unhappy i asked him he said hes unhappy because he has so many things he wants and he cant have them all
its all too easy to slip into that im cautious i had no ambition at all as a child i was more similar to my mum
its not about how quickly they happen its that sense of incompletion keep on wanting more i dont want that so there are some shifts in mindset i need to do
i need to get out of the mindset that its all about me
my career my future my success
why as in what happened
nah expectations are fine if anything i often shy away from aiming higher because fear of failing its the motivation behind my expectations i need to fix
lololol every now and then my brain gets trapped in a limbo where i explore all the feels and i get out of it with some conclusions that i forget in a few months and i go back in
nah if i spend too much time thinking about this i dont end up doing anything
yeah iâm also not very used to failures
i know itâs not so just trying to  strike  a balance
man i just want to go to a conference and present
oh so many all the medicine related conferences this is not undergrad not basic science research where itâs a lot of people on a project
resume itâs like publishing also i enjoyed conferences i went to itâs cool talking to people about their research
exactly publishing during med school is hard itâs a lot of work i realized i donât have that much time doing wet lab honestly was a mistake so conference presentations are good
iâm talking about right now iâm doing wet lab right now
cell staining and counting my project changed so much over the year i shouldâve seen this coming
windsor
philip karpowicz
itâs circadian rhythm but iâm doing only a part of the project
itâs not that interesting but reading papers donât necessary does either you propose new ideas but someone has to do the actual experiments
lol website is meh he does circadian rhythm in guts
yeah iâm gonna try iâm gonna make it to as many lab meetings as possible
it is it was my plan alreay
i agree that requires me to read a lot iâll try that
hahaha this is an interesting lab though my pi and the phd students are the only one who are reading literature the master students function like an undergrad student in my toronto lab
very good advice thank you frank
i realize a lot of things very late but better late than never
the grass is always greener elsewhere
exactly
night hows life friend
haha what report life is more or less good going in a direction i want
ah is your projet not so fun
it has stalled lol i had about half and then i started rewriting been thinking about going back to it its not really fiction though its a real story
i dont think so
maybe narrative
yeah neuro midterm two reports and one presentation one more exam this week and week after and another presentation
haha its okay not consequential but just annoying really challenging my time management skill considering right now there ar elot of things outside of school i want to maange
lab stuff is done for a bit didnt go for two weeks becuase of all the due dates i also missed lots of lectures when i prepared for my presentation so i had to catch up
okay haha just a fun time to learn some advocacy skills its way more complex than i imagined
unmatched medical graduates so something very important to us personally
lol savage
i mean the possibility is always there if i dont match i probably made a networking mistake or was just unlikely unlucky but these are unavoidable
for some competitive specialties the former is a real possibility stanley wants neurology which is a small program if i were in his position i may actually worry about not matching at all
but hes on it now makign connections searching for research op setting observations etc
ya happy to hear that i hope it goes well
yeah 34 weeks of elective in windsor while wrapping up research here 10 days of traveling not sure hwere yet and one month in toronto with my old pi
nah sickkids people
lucie dupuis shes a genetic counsellor at sickkis oh im also hoping to shadow a doc in toronto when im there
yup
nobecause it was kind of limited
but its left unfinished and i dont like that and i can just keep it as a quality improvement project not resesarch
yup im finishing up two modules i already started on last summer they already made connections with the paeds department to get us survey subjects we are pushing to more survey subjects
my pi got very positive feedbacks since i left the department on the modules and many docs want to see these done so we want to get them done
yeah
hehe they are only excited about what the projects potential so i need to deliver if this summer goes well i feel like my cv will be satisfactory enough for fourth year
yeah
do i i dont read reddit but i read about relatioship
oh
i wonder why we get jealous i mean i know why but is it a natural response or is it tied to how we grow up
theres a difference between jealousy and envy though envy is natural  wanting something that someone else has but jealousy  wanting something that someone else has and not wanting anyone else to have it
if you have ambition of any sort im sure you can be envious
mmm i guess but i think jealousy has a malicious intent in it wanting to be the best doesnt have to be malicious also i dont like performance comparing to others i use others to see how im doing
if someone is doing better than me that means im not doing well enough so i look up to them but that doesnt naturally mean i want someone else to do badly
yup so thats why i wonder if its external regardless of the originsource of jealousy i think its definitely someone can work on
interesting you brought this up my friends and i were just discussing this a few days ago they were talking about people in our class being jealous and i didnt even notice until they pointed it out
eh for that person i thinkim just gonna stay away hes been pretty rude to me a couple times so
oh i think he knows where he is academically i have no intention of letting him know how i do the less he knows the better
kk good luck
studying lol
hahaha i notice a trend in you frank
one time we chatted you had something due or an exam i dont remember
what do you mean
i have no idea
hmmm in canada itâs gonna be hard hospitals collaborate with businesses but rarely provide a platform for them cuz hospitals are so short on resources to begin with
nah i was studying for psych and then flew to nyc so v shitty at reso being right now responding
oh no iâm not for a conference just for the weekend with friends
good really chill saw some really good art
yup med friends
ah yes to varying degree but all above average for sure
absolutely
nope haha nothing beyond chm138
maybe ill have to dig
my idea is to build a website to address language barriers faced by immigrants the goal is to empower patients to become better advocates for their health by providing a curated library of translations useful in clinical encounters the website will characterize common presenting symptoms and better inform patients of the type of care they may receive
httpswwwdropboxcomsmpuj5xjkkeit8yqsyllabus20mgy470docdl0 yes
no this is for something else not gonna discuss that now though the link should take you to the file i didnt take bch242
nope lol
haha no problem i can tell you what i did take
wait i lied i have 425 httpswwwdropboxcomspgkm982uyp5uijmsyllabus20mgy425pdfdl0 also took mgy350 and a few csb courses
and thats it the rest are econ model organisms
hm i dont the course was v relaxed cuz the profs were relaxed it was mostly journal club httpswwwdropboxcomspgkm982uyp5uijmsyllabus20mgy425pdfdl0 you can look through the folder if you wish nope wrong link again httpswwwdropboxcomshc2cgua7y85lzvx1aadlpm628jqmswpyinzelradl0 what do you need these for
lol have you
nice you are more mgy than i am
yeah
im not sure i just dont ahve any
it wuldnt surprise me if there werent any though lol classic meneghini
i see
isnt that like blade runner
oooh its a cult classic you may like it
why detroit btw
i see a very bold mix
i see
not bad summer time but been busy in the hospital
im going to japan in two weeks
yeah
i have two weeks off
im in windsor for electives right now then travel
then toronto for my old project tokyo kyoto osaka
yeah first time there
haha i have a lot of med friends going this summer
nah we all planned independently lol
some people im not very close with
oh cool i can read some japanese cuz i read chinese but yeah i donât think language is necessarily gonna be a problem
true iâm not concerned about my trip at all right now and that should be concerning lol
lol canât see it on my phone but yay
donât have one at the moment will do after 20th
yeah
hmm too many but all in very different way most adorable experience was a hole in the wall jazz bar and it was like a lost in translation moment most amazing architecture is just all of tokyo lol
haha i did i walked into an 18 anime section there was no girls there and i didnât want the guys to feel judged so i didnât stay long
japan is a very sensitive crowd everyone does the same thing more or less
so when you donât people are like who are you
i was just observing them in genera itâs a polite culture but conforming culture but then you have pockets of oddness that everyone seems to accept
what
i think i saw one right close to our hotel didnât know it was a cram school
nope
hi this thursday lol why we should catch up you can meet some starbucks students they have fun projects
iâm not presenting haha
you can grill the other kids

happy thanksgiving howâs japan
shifts are okay some busy some easy
iâm glad you appreciate i am at work lol waiting for lecture tho
each yeah i like the lectures they are way more relevant now
mhm iâm enjoying clerkship so far which is a good design sign
i donât think being in biomes will help with that
i know p what company are you working for again
remind me what youâre doing there
great the robots can cure your cancer hey thanks friend how are you doing
not too bad on paeds which is not busy itself but the lecture schedule is brutal and we didnât get taught much paeds last two years so there is a lot to learn
aw youâre still pretty early in your comp sci career you will get there
i like kids but i end up dealing more with parents so
ooh whichlab mars is nice toronto is nice i like kids until they cry
doesn doesnt surprise me
yes just a dinner
haha do i normally not look happy
of course why wouldnât i be
hahaha thanks  i did have a very good day clerkship and seeing people sick make you extra grateful for health and friends when are you coming back
thatâs true for me too tbh
to visit maybe
haha you have other friends   and youâll make friends mars have awesome people
half of mol gen is there so yeah
awww thatâs cute he wants to go back yeah
wow rude why tho
haha i know torontonis competitive i agree even for internal med which is a much bigger program iâm not sure if i can get in
are you coming home soon
ah i see yeah sadly
its okay back in the groove i dont mind it
i know haha motivated for 2019 lets see how long it lasts lol
yeah man
just through my dad really
but coincidentally i was reading a nytimes article about the chinese economy 2019 isnt looking oo good
chinese government is already starting to stimulate the economy property market is trash stock market is trash job market is trash china never built a solid diverse economy imo
lol make some people rich first
that was his logo for the economic policy in the 90s
kind of similar to trickle down economics in the sense that you benefit a select group and they benefit the rest
no a lot of people did but not everyone people were lifted out of poverty because of urbanization imo but the income inequality is only getting worse
but there are people starving and struggling fewer than before for sure
but the wealth in china increased the cost of living so the not so wealthy poeple are having trouble keeping up sure but just because there are many people doesnt mean they shouldnt try
it is but i fear that they are slipping backward now people are gonna fall back to poverty thats my fear sure the 90s and early 2000s were amazing definitely made a difference
gonna go to bed
busy for the next few days so expect randomly timed replies
lol thanks i prefer work hard and be happy
i did read it and he is an asshole was my conclusion
oh heâs a great innovator but heâs an asshole as a person i separate how people are as people and how people are as thinkers a successful person is successful but doesnât conceal the fact they are shitty people
i guess there were pretty cool parts too lol his work ethics is insane and he is uber smart i guess hes better than steve jobs at least
i appreciate his goals and visions and i buy into it i donât feel like i want to be him tho
i think the world needs improving but not saving thereâs a negative connotation to saving the world that suggests that everyone is in the wrong  probably true  and only a select few seem to see it and work on it but for humanity to move forward improving the world is a better attitude as it is an invitation to everyone to be part of it and start with themselves
nice you back in to
i wont be able to run unity on my laptop until saturday night because i have to conserve space for a virtual machine i have to install for hacking contest im in on saturday but im still interested in implementing your idea
i feel like varying in colour would be fairly straightforward deformability would be more complex but could possibly be achieved by glueing two objects with different properties together
i think at some point most of the work would have to be done in a 3d modelling application like blender
whats an example of what an object that uses your idea im not sure i understand it completely
that makes sense it definitely sounds doable as its easy enough to simulate gravity and repulsion in unity and i dont think it would be too hard to have two separate classes of objects that behave differently toward each other i would be interested in coding something like that in javascript
ya i guess magnets always try to align themselves with the magnetic field lines so maybe wed have to approximate the field over the area where the objects are and have everything rotate appropriately unity keeps track of the local and global position of all objects using xyz vectors so at least it would be straightforward to determine what direction the positive side of a magnet is facing at any point in time
sounds good see you then
i look forward to talking more about your magnet concept later today however i also have an idea that ill probably work on implementing my idea is learn how to create the destructive terrain used in games like worms and liero which i believe were based on modifying bitmaps and possibly make a game set in space like gravity wars httparmorgamescomplay7557graviteewars where characters can jump between planets and the terrain is destructive
i also only enjoy coding so im not interested in the event if its just pitching ideas but i think ill go tonight just to see if there are any other coders that show up
im at the event now when you get here im sitting in the back on the right side of the screen
library first floor room 150 beside the copy room
tonight ill try out some stuff i can also check out the rts link if you can send it i probably wont get anything significant accomplished this weekend my plan is to just refresh my unity skills your team sounds interesting too bad its not all programmers or you could have the game on steam by the end of the weekend
sounds good let me know the general area of what you think youll need help with whenever you know so i can start researching in advance when you said animation originally i thought of those videos where the person films themselves drawing on white paper with a black marker i think thats the classic way to make a pitch video but i dont know really how to do it an ipad or something might have an app that can do it or if you had a stylus
that seems like it will work pretty well unity has good animation controls hey i just finished with my security competition it was really fun and informative hows everything going with unity any issues
i suggest hosting the video on youtube and embedding a link heres a quick unity project i just put together in case anything you see interests you richard sent a video
do you have a project manager or is it you
i used quicktime which is a builtin screen recorder for mac
ya ill arrive whenever you do and probably stay until one or so i have unity on my laptop now
i could drop by for 30min to look at what youve done so far should i do that
i assume things were stressful today but how did everything work out overall were you able to walk away with a clearer vision for you idea
heres a fun game jam show about people getting together for a weekend and making a game if your interested httpstoresteampoweredcomapp288290 some unity games look amazing but ive yet to figure out how to design a compelling game world next time we get together it would be fun to talk about art style and maybe look up some reference photos
it looks through but i wish there were more pictures heres a unit selection tutorial i found and some photos of a 2d3d cell cute artwork is my favourite art style the best 3d ive seen is in mario games and in my opinion the best 2d art is minimalist 2d art httphyunkellcomblogrtsstyleunitselectioninunity5 i still cant think of a good way to represent membrane gates both accurately and aesthetically
you can send him this rchrogerscom ill look into his company but i dont think ill have much time or knowledge that he would be interested in thanks though
thanks im planning to attend the game dev club meet up tomorrow so maybe ill see you there i recently tested out a version of my web based multiplayer 2d space game and im probably going to start building a second version with unity in order to build in more complicated physics
i agreed to help out with some ruby on rails front end development for the two weeks that i have between semesters it will be good experience for me because i dont have any experience writing code for an employer
i think building the tutorial apps with both nodejs and rails is the best way to get comfortable with full stack development rails apparently does a lot of stuff for the developer which sometimes results in the developer not actually knowing whats going on
ill try and let him know see you next week
ya but i cant really think of a good niche for myself because i think nonprogrammers should just use square space and also im not a designer so all i really do is put together templates and most clients would want some way to update there site themselves and im not really interested in training clients how to use various content management systems im interested in talking with potential clients
sure they can contact me at rchrogerscom and let me know what theyre looking for and ill tell them if i can do it
thanks i plan to attend tomorrow
ok thanks
ive used the instantiate method to create a new instance of a prefab but nothing else
make a public reference to a gameobject in your script and then drag your prefab from its folder to the correct field in the editor then in your script use instantiate to create an instance of the prefab this is how you can make a new prefab without previously having it in the game world
then set enabled to false immediately after creation
you can create an array that holds dictionary objects and each dictionary would hold the info for one message it may also be possible to have a private or inner class in c similar to java however you will probably always need at least one empty gameobject in your scene to attach the script to in order to invoke the start method
no problem i wish i had more time to program but ive just been alternating between watching tv and studying for thursday however i did enter a 2 hour programming competition on a site i recently found called code forces it looks like they have contests every week
today i investigated something called editorscripts in unity with editorscripts i was able to create scripts that permanently modified the gameobjects in my scene i could create new menu items in unity itself or add buttons to the editor which would runs my scripts i like to build large programatically generated worlds and now i have a way to do it outside of runtime so that my generated scenes are visible outside of gameplay
not bad i work mon to wed then i have thurs to sun for personal projects i want to start making larger worlds however i dont like to position every object manually and i like to view my worlds outside of gameplay so editorscripts are very convenient for me how has your break been
i really enjoyed following this blender tutorial awhile ago httpscgitutspluscomtutorialssecretstocreatinglowpolyillustrationsinblendercg31770
i didnt know anything when i started it it you look at section 3 modeling the terrain it gives a step by step guide
no i stoped attending meetings when they had limited spots in the tournament and gave priority to people who werent showing up to practice but also since january until the end of exams ive been focusing on school but i dont think future semester will be as busy for me
i would still have like to at least play everyone who was slotted ahead of me at least once instead of being bumped off the team because other club member who i never saw once were better friends with the organizer
i just felt that the club seemed not very excited about new members in terms of making a game this summer my plan is to make a few prototype unity projects in order to learn how to make a start menu save game data and make a more filled out game world sometime this summer thought i would like the have a game on par with this game httpssarahgoulditchioprospora which was noticeably very simple and limited when i played it and had the same kind of bugs and hangups that i notice in my own code however it has the appearance of a final product which i would like my own stuff to have
i would like to go to the game jam but i feel like its already full id attend a jam jam if you organized one or if one was held first semester assets are so key i wonder how much it would cost to commission an artist to make a set of chemistry assets
theres this tutorial where you make donuts that i want to try next httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjyj6e72rds
ya i prefer menus to hotkeys as well i hear blender is all about hotkeys maybe we should look into taking a short blender course at algonquin or something if one were offered
in edmonton i would take these 2 day weekend courses on photoshop and i found it nice
the only problem is its hard to find courses at the right time
well send me some pictures if you make any neat assets with blender
i also just learnt that 100 pixels  1 unit by default in unity i never knew before what size in unity units my images were after i imported them
heres the first blender object ive made entirely myself its an ice cream bar
i watched a few episodes of the donut tutorial and then found one about modelling rigging and animation im most interested in 3d character animation for games httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdiiowrolirw
i have this idea that i want to make a prototype game where a character is in a low poly cave and can preform various animations in order to move around and interact with the stones and walls of the cave however i dont have a clear enough idea yet about how animation works in order to tell what will be achievable
at some point it becomes very art intensive id like to take some inhouse drawing courses ideally id like to go someplace downtown on some week nights during the semester
when i say lessons im taking about learning what equipment to buy how to hold a pencil properly what the correct measurements are for bodies and faces and the basics of perspective and lighting i would also like someone to watch me draw and give pointers on my work as i make it none of that is necessary but when ive learnt other things in the past ive found in person coaching to greatly accelerate the process and keep me much more interested
check out this downtown ottawa course i just found on video game design with blender 10 july to 28 aug 245 mondays 630 to 9pm httpsartottawacaregisterforaclasscampusfocusgeneralinterestsemestercategorycomputerartssearchtextentersearchcriteria i just registered
this appears to be to perfect course for me its pretty much exactly what im looking for
the highest quality render ive been able to get from blender still has a lot of noise artifacts
the way blender can manipulate objects in a sometimes eerily perfect manner is one of the most impressive feats of software that ive experienced id never have thought that i could almost accidentally make a near perfect looking cup handle in just a few clicks and drags without any weird edge artifacts
heres some more intro videosi found the shortcutkey guy mentions them in his fifth video httpscgcookiecomcourseblenderbasics
ya i thought so
soon im going to look up how to import object to unity from what ive heard theres a few tricks to it
oh thats good some artists told me once that you had to invert the normals sometimes maybe that was to avoid some material problem or something
it could still be inside out though
heres my final product after the donut tutorial i get a lot of fuzzy dots in my renders actually i think i just had to increase the number of samples and choose final render mode instead
i was impressed by yours as well
im watching a tutorial on shaders in unity right now and this guy just applied a sine based transformation to every pixel on the screen based on the frame count of the scene and the whole unity game scene became waves but he could still look around and move objects as per normal he could also tint the entire view different colours a few years ago when i was messing around with shader i made this video httpswwwfacebookcomrichardhayes39750videosvb1000001320745421153016478046077type3theater
while making 2d pieces of a broken apart space ship for my unity game i learnt you can add a metallicemission texture to a sprite to indicate how reflectivebright individual parts of a sprite are i also decided on another art style i like where things look hand drawn and informal like this piece of a spaceship
i started the space game idea awhile ago originally i worked mostly on game mechanics then recently i worked out what the first part of the story will be and  restarted with a blank project and now im working mostly on art to support the story
ive already given up half way on more projects than i can count
a typical project cycle for me is that i spend a lot of time learning how to do what i want but once i learn how to theoretically accomplish my goal i lose interest and move to another project although i have realized that as i get more skill i make it farther along before putting projects aside whats you work
you can always take to blender course that i found and guarantee at least 4 hours a week
another strategy i use is to convince another person to work on a project with me and then i feel like im letting them down if i dont hold up my side of the work but other people often lose interest much faster
ya im looking forward to when i have enough work experience that companies send me recruitment emails
i still dont know exactly what i want to get into but i always find game optimization interesting like only rendering geometry when its in view and offloading computations to the gpu so ill probably try harder to get an internship in a game studio next summer
i would imagine most companies would have artist and programmer as separate roles although they would work closely together even the 5 person web dev shop im at part time right now has a designer that makes mockups and then we just program according to the design template
im taking a painting course in the upcoming fall semester
i only have 4 mandatory courses next semester so i added painting as a fifth then painting is a prereq for drawing which ill take fall 2018
ya the closest i saw was a course about video media art
i imagine theres a lot of crossover from manual drawingpainting to digital plus as was pointed out to me photoshop is basically painting in some regard especially if you use a tablet ive never looked into carleton courses but algonquin has a 3year game dev degree
ya see you
the lone developer of stardew valley began building the game in c out of college where his courses were mostly java one of his school projects was to build tetris from scratch he worked 10 hours a day 7 days a week for 4 years on the game and then 15 hour days in support after release theres a few interview articles online i guess if so many people are trying to build games at least one person will have a good amount of success every now an then
have you seen the recent email about google code jamâs kickstart online coding challenges designed specifically for students live training on june 7 and practice contest on june 11th
my opinion is that practicing code challenges should be an ongoing activity because they reinforce the basics of coding technique competitions serve as a good bench mark to allow people to determine their current skill level
hey we should sign up for something like this httpsitchio a site that lets people find and share indy games for free it appears that people can also buy and sell games from the site
how is you summer going now i was completely involved with the wolfram summer camp for about the last three weeks so i put everything else on hold now im just getting back into things im doing a bit of work for shahaans game my goal is to implement the simplest ai possible but right now im investigating the a search algorithm because it offers some neat behaviour
ive recently decided to start watching more playthroughs of notable games as i dont always feel like going through them myself and sometimes i dont have the right pc for them
i dont like to install games on my main imac or laptop and i havent set up my windows pc which is still in my parents basement i did buy a switch though i played through zelda and mario kart
it got canceled so i signed up for a beginner drawing course but they started drawing live naked people so i decided not to attend
i did it cost the same amount plus there was a list of like 20 different supplies you had to buy but i didnt buy anything
one time i paid for a movie and decided to leave before it even started so i have a record of paying for things and then not using them one time i paid for a flight with a connection and just got off halfway and onto another flight to a different city because the times were better i also paid one time for a hotel then realized i had a tick on me and spend all night wandering around montreal looking for a hospital then i checked out the next morning having only spend like 5 min in the room so ive burnt much more money in the past
im now good with a program called mathematica and can program in the wolfram language also i understand much more about cellular automata and stephen wolframs theory about a computational universe and a new kind of science
ya totally
ya after a few years of learning on my own before university i realized i needed to go to a place where i would at least hear the name of many important concepts so i could at least know i wasnt missing anything critical when learning on my own
for me the impossible problem is that the number of things scales exponentially with the square footage of the game world the solution i play around with is how can i have as little detail as possible to still convey the necessary story i think the best chance i have is procedural generation heres a forest scene i made in unity for the purpose of testing my a search
a simple use i think of is the basic idea of room escape games interestingly just the simple fact of being locked in a room in a game means one can probably escape however imagine in a game somehow we make the room exist inside itself so that every time you leave the room you actually reenter somehow portal sort of used this idea a bit my idea though is to have a doll house in a room in a game and you can enter to doll house and find a room with a doll house inside to infinity
cool
thats definitely getting close to walking simulator quality put some cheese on that cutting board
see you
im just doing some light web dev at my work are you finding that jobs often dont provide enough of a consistent challenge thats often my problem
i have a much simpler game im working on now thats a clone of a flash game called phage wars heres some good code challenges  that i recently finished httpadventofcodecom
some of the problems are really clever the story is just silly but the ascii art is really well done and it lights up and animated as you complete problems i would like to make a site like this one one day
i struggle a bit with user accounts server side info storage and most of all its really hard to write good challenges but i have some puzzles hidden on my site httprhayes
hey on what site did you buy the textbook for data and algorithms
check this out if youre into rd httpscareersunitycompositionrdstudentworker755547
i just applied
ya i wrote a halfpage for the cover letter about myself and my experiences my new strategy is to write longer applications to a few companies that i really want i dont know how it works for coop but i would imagine if a company is not on the list you could work something out with the coop office if you got accepted
is your next coop in the winter or next summer
shoppify has a program they call the wintern ship program i went to a presentation last year my instinct is to try an avoid government work as much as possible so shoppifys another option
i wouldnt take on anything officially but im always interested in making prototypes over a few days are there any interesting technical challenges with the idea
i have some understanding of how reflections work technically i think theyre mostly a view from a different camera rendered in the world it would be interesting to design one very simple demo level and work on it during a weekend or something shahaan mentioned he might try and set up one or two gamejams during the year
heres a video of the space game ive been putting together richard sent a video
its heavily inspired by a game called phage wars which is really fun and simple httparmorgamescomplay2675phagewars
its basically a clone of phage wars but im sure found that cloning a game make it way easier to make design choices and after laying phage wars i just wanted more phage wars but now that i know kind of how the phage wars mechanics work i may consider making a campaign style version of phage wars ultimately though everything is a clone of another thing people think that good art is original and thats a creative block for them until they learn to take proven ideas from elsewhere and use them some pretty successful games like 2048 clash of clans and call of duty are basically clones of the games before them
theres this indy game dev called sarah gould she seems to make ultra simple indy games that dont rely heavily on art i find her stuff interesting because it all seems really attainable ive played a free game she made called prospora and just tried out ungrounded which is 1 httpssarahgoulditchio
i exported the game project from unity to the browser which is called building for html 5 then i hosted the resulting folder including the indexhtml file in a github ghpages branch which then allows people to visit the hosted file
file  build settings  webgl  build and you make be asked to install the web build tools
you can double click the indexhtml file and the game should run in a browser   if you havent used github pages before heres the tutorial httpspagesgithubcom you can look at the game club ghpages branch for an example
some browsers dont have the plugin safari does chrome might not
if you mean csi 2110 then no i havent seen that prof take attendance in any lecture yet
if that game developers writing a game about the runtime analysis of implementing a stack via doubling a fixed size array then you didnt miss much
i would look at the slides actually the prof said that the analysis we did today was nontrivial
ieee extreme programming challenge httpswwwfacebookcomevents130390454264934acontext7b22actionhistory223a227b5c22surface5c223a5c22messaging5c222c5c22mechanism5c223a5c22attachment5c222c5c22extradata5c223a7b7d7d227d and also uotthack after xmas and google kickstart online round this sunday httpscodegooglecomcodejamkickstart
also this in april httpcgexpoca
fill this form and say that youre looking for a team but know that at some point youll have to pay 15 or 20 for a one year member ship to the ieee foundation httpsdocsgooglecomformsde1faipqlsd1ebjakdermmbu3hnmrmbivboqekkpmz1uqzzmiurutmwviewform
ieee extreme last year was a lot of fun we worked for 24 hours straight on the challenges in a room at carleton and got free subway sandwiches delivered periodically
the form is mostly to sort out teams youll need an ieee member number once teams are formed and someone registers up officially i know the guy semiorganizing it so i can make sure you know when the next part of the registration happens
the guys name is matt langlois on fb and hes a fourth year now who interned at github last summer if you want to send him any questions
im going to the one in montreal in oct i dont know if there still tickets though
i think there might be some studio founders at some of them i just want to see whos in the community
i dont have any details yet
i could help people out but i would also want to participate
ya i would like to be in a team i think longer jams are better but during school it might be best to keep it to one day also i heard that uottawa doesnt allow allnight events so longer than 12 hours would have to be split up into two parts maybe one day of jamming and then 1 or 2 hours then next day of presenting and trying others games
i just applied to httpshackwesterncom
i didnt see any essays i just wrote that i would teach myself to grant wishes and that i made a time table web app
ya that course is whack
no i found only a difference of a few milliseconds across 100 million constructer calls   i started a timer in nanoseconds called the constructor 100 million times and stopped the timer and found extremely close results for d2 d3 and d5   what have you found
heres my results i didnt find that how many trials did you do for each i took the adv of 12 batches of 100 million trials richard sent a photo
ya i actually did 20 batches of 100 mill so my maxmin are the maxmin for 2 billion calls my mean time and total are averages of 20 batches
ya see you later my thinking though is that maxmin are not a good indication statically because a single outlier could really make them different standard deviation captures outliers somewhat i calculated but didnt report std dev and it showed results in some cases that design 5 had a significantly tighter standard deviation
i sent an email about ieee to you just now 2110 midterm is 29 oct 35pm mnt 201204 and 207
youâd have to talk about it via email with your team but i also know that your other team member mohamed is only planning to attend for a few hours as well
ok
i put around 5 key methods in total spread about all the classes
i donât think they want getter and setters just methods that demonstrate that we know how the classes interact
so far we started talking about maps and are now talking about deleting arbitrary nodes from a binary search tree without regard to selfbalancing
looks like we wonât talk about balancing until after reading week which indicates that it wonât be on the midterm today ended after removing nodes from a binary search tree which apparently is included on the midterm
i went back and looked at my code for lets cheer up bob and found the reason it was failing 13 of the test cases i never removed boards where i had already won prior to bob winning
my thinking was that the three smallest keys would be the root the left child and the right child
ya that makes sense
i now think it takes 3 comparisons
for me itâs deferred to the final iâm actually in montreal right now at cgexpo we had some great talks this morning a lot of studio founders telling there origin stories
i had already prepaid so that helped
hereâs a decent web comic about game development that i learnt about httpwwwthemeatlycomcomicroll how did you like the midterm
i gave up trying for 100 in seg but i feel i still have a good chance in other courses with more objective answers
for 3f i just said if 10000 is the smallest element then it will take 5000 compairisions is the old csi2110 midterm online anywhere
i found it itâs on bright space but itâs buried
ya i just accepted the invite yesterday i plan to take the bus but i donât have details yet
cool
yes
yes at first it was running slow because i was calling substring but then i made it fast by iterating over the string with a for each loop
or on
ya that makes sense
iâll probably be there in 20 min
the three nodes are the root and the two compressed nodes
i forwarded an email where the prof says itâs three so i assume the root should not be removed
my algorithm did remove the root but once they said it should stay i decided that perhaps every tree stores âthe empty stringâ and so maybe the root could be seen as a node storing the empty string
ya i go through the same cycle every assignment i do the assignment a week later it changes and i do it again
i donât know if we finished it but we covered all four types of pivots
we basically did lecture 9 on tues
it has a lot of pictures of pivots but either way we did lecture 9
also she said to search online for âavl animationâ and make a really unbalanced tree using the interactive tool httpswwwcsusfcaedugallesvisualizationavltreehtml
for mytrie i tested insert by inserting 10k random binary strings and checking the size of the tree i tested search by verifying that 10k randomly inserted binary strings were found and i tested printstringsinlexicoorder by sorting 10k binary strings and comparing the output of the tree against javas sort method i tested the compressed tries printstringsinlexicoorder against mytries  and i tested that a compressed trie always has less nodes than a randomly generated uncompressedtrie
i felt good testing anything that i had a way to generate valid random test cases for
im hoping that one of my 10k random tests would hit one of those weird cases or that the ta will just see that i have test cases and give me the marks without further investigation
i might not sleep or iâll just sleep on the floor
most likely iâll sleep a lot on the bus then on the floor sometime saturday night and on the bus on the way back
well if the events fun enough then you just work until you pass out naturally
the time always goes by fast and people feel groggy around 24am but then they feel better when the sun comes up
iâd like to make a procedurally generated walking simulator with a voxel world similar to how minecraft looks
qualify for what
a steam game called proteus was released in 2013 it has an 810 on meta critic costs 10 in proteus you can do nothing other than walk proteus is a highly rated game that people buy for money on steam and enjoy more than real games thus a game can be highly rated and sold for money and feature only walking the appeal of these games is relaxation meditation and reflection   making a walking simulator is an achievable goal for a small team in a short time larger projects take more time and a larger team
from what iâve seen at hackathons if a game or app has at least one screen of catchy visuals then people will be interested but i donât care about winning my goal is just to make something interesting
have you met a team yet i will probably wait until the event itself
i have a theory about the map data structure since a map can be implemented with a balanced tree or a hashing algorithm  and both implementations have different strengths and weaknesses maps make a great interview question maps also make a person sound really smart when described
i feel that a close line is represented by an id of a destination station meaning that a person cannot travel over an edge with a destination id equal to the closed line i assume that a walking edge cannot be closed the part im uncertain about is how to identify stations as part of the same line
a station has an iâd for every line that itâs part of however from my observations a station can be connected to another line via a metroedge or a walkingedge and thus when traversing the graph i have no clear way to determine when i step into another line at first i thought lines were always separated by the walking edges but that seems not to be he case
if you want to compare heres what i get when i query the shortest route from 174 to 113 richard sent a photo
i skipped the first question ive only done the second so far
what is your strategy to find the same line
that sounds pretty close to correct ill look at a few cases and let you know what i find i have a suspicion that q1 requires a dfsbfs
i mean i think that at least one line may have a fork structure in it requiring a dfs rather than simply moving linearly from one node to the next but i havent found anything that goes against your assumption yet
im suspicious of the yellow and orange line richard sent a photo
ya heres potential proof richard sent a photo
lots of connections around the orange line with only some walking edges a dfsbfs could find them all my question now though is what constitutes travel order if the line is not a line
ya i dont know how to print it i sent her an email on friday but no response yet so i skipped that question
you know it
good night
ok thanks
iâm just going to find the shortest path but not traverse any edges that end with the âbrokenâ vertex i plan to use the same function with a small modification
depending on your implementation if you just remove one vertex you may still have to do some error checking to ensure that you donât traverse an edge that leads to a vertex that doesnât exist
ya i get the same answer i think both our methods work i got some vague answers from the prof my questions are in purple richard sent a photo richard sent 2 photos
ok get ready for advent of code this friday by joining the private leaderboard httpadventofcodecom 19329270cd04eb
applications now open httpsuottahackcom
i plan to just ignore the test cases but i can test specific ones if you want to send them over
richard sent a photo
check out the google doodle today the last level is a very interesting puzzle when it comes to finding the shortest solution
how
ya it should be a straight forward fix this prof is so stupid
ya but she spent a week and a half trying to figure out what she thought a line was i think sheâs done a few too many âlinesâ of coke if you know what i mean
if your talking about compete connectivity depending on your starting node you might not be able to reach every node because of the directed edges but for shortest paths in general i feel that i got decent results
i asked the prof that on the last day of class she said you can just draw a graph with an edge directly connecting two people with whatever edge weight is in the table and just forget about the middle man   i never looked into it beyond that but it may be the case that the anonymous people donât matter for dijkstraâs   my thinking is that one could add more certified âhalfwayâ along each edge but all original vertices would still be visited in the same order
i played firewatch and liked it
i got the same for q5
ya same thing richard sent a photo
if youre interested in a competition called csgames on march 23rd in montreal then heres some contact info for last minute registration httpcsgamesorgcorpo csgamesuocsclubca
itâs pretty good i just got back from cusec on saturday that was a great conference lots of smart people and interesting talks this semester iâll be doing some coding in prolog scheme and go
sure
that would be interesting it would be nice to discuss the idea in detail before starting to have a clear idea of what we want before investing too much time in code
whatâs the date and location of the event
i signed up should i ask a few people i know if they want to join us they donât have game experience or do you want to try and find experienced people
maybe post on the software eng facebook page
it seems that anyone can i often see job offers and event postings
ok
sounds good i hope to learn new things from whoever we can get on our team
ya im looking forward to it and theres a uottawa game dev club 12 hour jam the weekend after
i dont really know anyone with game dev experience so i didnt find anyone
ill mostly just work in unity
i use a photoshop style image editor often to make 2d art for games if thats what youre referring too
i refer to that concept as shaders
not when im awake for 48 hours
there pretty obscure and very matrixy but ive heard a tool called shader forge is the way to do it
i dont think we have to worry about polish
ya me too i just want to make something functional
good night
this document has some good info about the jam httpwwwcsitcarletoncaaryagamejamggjinfopdf just making sure youve seen it
ok iâll see who i meet
6138887280
iâll be there at 430
iâm there now
apparently 5 is the intro video so if you can do 450 you might be better off but either way iâll start looking for teams and save you a spot if i find anything
hey i found two guyâs that havenât used unity before we can be on a team with them if we want maybe they can do âsoftâ work and we could use be the programmers or we could pick a different platform
they donât use anything but they know python and java they would do like generic design and contribute to the idea
iâll keep looking around thereâs not many people here right now but i hear that it gets really crowded by 5pm so it might be crazy
i met up with josiah one other guy left so i now have me josiah and one other guy here in the back corner of lab 236
iâm outside the building but itâs locked
my username should be âstrawstackâ i think i found a tunnel
rhrhkiwi
we merged alexâs level and pushed the results to github iâm heading out now and everyone else is gone as well see you tomorrow
sounds good to me
ya you can go ahead and do it let me know if you need anything but github is the latest version so it should be good
project files httpsgithubcomstrawstackggj2018   game link httpsstrawstackgithubioggj2018webbuild2 a movie scene recreated in blender for use in vr  httpswwwredditcomrmoviescomments7wehbfimcurrentlyrecreatingmovieframesin3dstjdgolm4osh4ffd1ec3
iâve coded in the shader files directly but unity 2018 supposedly has a built in graphical tool for that
i made this with shaders httpswwwyoutubecomeditouvideoidqqci25nmmf8 heres unity 2018s shader editor httpsblogsunity3dcom20180227introductiontoshadergraphbuildyourshaderswithavisualeditor
heres another link i used a shader on the object and one in the space inside the door only when the object is viewed through the door will it render to the view httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqqci25nmmf8featureyoutube
it was really easy to make my thing i just had to add a flag in one shader and a check for the flag in another i actually learnt nothing about shaders while making it  iâm slowly following a course called âshaderschoolâ to learn about shaders in general but the shaders inside unity are different and more complicated   my guess is that a mirror would require the shader to cast a ray for each fragment and sample a colour at a given point in the scene i wonder if fragment shaders can cast rays and sample the texture that the ray hits
my guess would be that instead of calculating only the angle of the ray from the playerâs head to the point on the mirror one would have to calculate the angle from the playerâs head to each fragment of the mirror when that fragment is being rendered
i think each fragment needs to calculate a value for itself relative to the player and the location of the fragment rather than just calculating once and using that angle for each fragment
i donât think iâll read the code but you could send the files if you want
whenever you finally learn it it would be cool to also add a small amount of noise so the mirror appears to have a very slight distortion effect on the reflection like real mirrors
i saw a guy add noise once by reading from a texture that contained black and white pixels he used the colour of the ânoiseâ texture at different locations to offset his calculation at each fragment
iâm sure we could take the carleton course if we wanted
maybe iâll do udemy over the summer
richard sent a photo itâs even less for me
maybe it saw your search history and knew youâd pay more
should buy it in incognito mode
i just bought it looks like they do charge differently sometimes richard sent a photo
i am a new user so i think it was trying to get me on board
youll probably get 9 more use out of it than me at least until the summer
ya shader development i think is always a needed area but not many people can do it at all
or udemy decides to charge them double
ya i was born in 1990
did you have any luck with unity shaders i found the udemy course focused almost entirely on surface shaders
ya iâve been working since the beginning of may at microsoft in vancouver itâs been fun so far the people are great and the office is nice vancouver also has a lot of great hiking and waterfront running
looks good it will certainly come in handy for someone trying to determine the max speed in unity before things start to look weird my team is working on a unity web app as well this summer as part of our project
i mean the max speed before thereâs a noticeable jump between each frame
hey iâm doing great i have a couple tough classes this semester but iâm enjoying it did string buffer solve it iâm been meeting up with some problem and doing leet code questions on thursdays and iâve found that code forces has some good competitions on a regular basis
im taking computer arch ii database ii design of algorithms i programming concepts and simulation attached is my solution to the string problem richard sent an attachment
arch ii is assembly and c
have you seen the most recent round of google code jam kickstart httpscodegooglecomcodejamcontest5374486dashboard
well keep sending me code challenges i live on those things
later im headed to bed
cpp taught some stuff about garbage collection and true sting length running code from the command line is something i learn from google code jam architecture ii is helping me understand what compilers do i would say though that at most class teaches theory and iâve only gotten practice from doing code challenges on my own
do you have time for this httpwwwmoab200com ð
dec 2019 so one year from now
backend is what i would prefer or full stack with an emphasis on the backend and games as a hobby
thereâs a good game developer called morris in first year thatâs been coming out to uogdc meetings he has a few nice looking games
we need one more person were at 1415 i made posts in the uottawa facebook groups alright were at 16 people now d we can make it official
yeee hey frank do you wanna go to the ottawa battleroyale this weekend httpwwwbattleroyalecabr10 its a gaming tournament only 5 tickets remaining
yes theres dota2 i dont know anyone else that plays dota here we can make a team over there
ok
ok should i buy a ticket then
im definiitely going if u are
done i bought a ticket u better not bail on me xd
aiiiiiiii yo the battle royale people just said that they only have 3 others participating in dota 2 which is obviously not even enough for a single team so hes offering a refund
dont know havent asked yet should we
alright poop
ok
ill check it out once im off the bus
is that ta coming in this month
right but the thing is he has professional credibility
just to teach basics yes its something we can do but its more effective and convincing if he does it
alright well do it ourselves only because you say that hes a borinf teacher thats the opposite of what were trying to achieve
however in that case we should start with more basic game dev software like game maker so lets make a post about game maker first
alright well do meetings every week then because a week and a half gap with no discussion of whats going on is really bad
lets just ask in the chat whether they want to do gamemaker or unity
we cant meet tomorrow our timings dont match
yes i agree thats what im saying
yeah then dont invite him well do it ourselves
night
yeah
ok
in the bus
wut
u said 1
ill be there by 105ish the was late a few mins so httpswwwdropboxcomsst39xjpcuthhadvhalo20portableexedl0
talk there so the others can see and pitch in their own suggestions
so well do the unity workshop on the 3rd then ok
yes
are we trying for fss this time
no no we definitely want to create a gaming community along with it its a huge incentive for people to come
yes let me know about the booking asap so that i can make and plan the event accordingly
yes i dont live on campus so i would have to bus all the way there for that so if you can sort that out that would be greta great
theyre probably just gonna say to fill out the form which i have is it possible to use the same method of renting out the room for fss as you did with cby
try morriset library
because im pretty sure you have to be an fss student to book one of their rooms and the library will probably have a bunch of available rooms
nah just ask for whatevers available all the rooms in the library are decently sized
its fine well just bring extensions i have 2 six slotters so 12 slots
httpselearningindustrycom6reasonsstoryboardsinelearning

its hard to find an internship
i think its 12 there are positions but more competitive and experienced people
experienced is very important in my indy industry
no even no any feedback
but there are people find jobs who have the same background as me
but the first job is quite hard
people who are in grade older than me people who came here 67 years ago
they took 1 month4 years to find a professional job
i think i can do cad drawing right now thats the easiest thing i have to looking for professional volunteering chances thats the way to accumulate experience
i am looking for them now
its not vey possible to do personal project there are many water related positions online but i am not very interested in doing that
yes he recommended me to be volunteering learn programming to be more competitive
because gis is related to programming many positions prefer people who can programming that is a useful skill for my industry

if two people gave different effort into a relationship that wouldnt last for a long time for example a loves b so much but b shows not that much love to a
yes he was tired and left no matter how i beg him afterwards actually we had same level of pain
yes
the first two ones i was not taking very seriously because i was too young and never thinking about marriage ð but last one i was taking him seriously but my way to deal with a relationship was wrong
i didnt gain experience from the first two people when i was still small yes of course
at that time i think i didnt gain much at that age but when i recalled that period i learn some now lol haha

yes i have to learn read 3 textbooks to read
622 probably
i think its probably at july if i come back late but i am not very sure actually i really want to come back soon
of course for my dear boyfriend
fortunately we will have lots of time together next semester
cuz i wont graduate in advance
if all things goes smoothly i will graduate in summer next year
switching to civil engineering is for that reason

you didnt tell the content after you called him that you were uncomfortable with giving sin number you just said he was probably a legitimate person
well if you are giving me a conclusion you might need give me the reason that where this conclusion coming from i still thought he was asking your sin number before last night
yes i already knew those from the phone call i gave you around 10pm last night
so now we knew caro is his wife name and he will sign his signature after i move in there is no problem right
good
no
i feel safe now

then you can ask him
hey if you want to ask him why dont you ask him directly
by your own
please do

i didnt show him my  identity as well
lets ask him show his identity when we move in thats less rude

i cant explain to you now its meaningless for you to know this now
ok i just found its too complex to explain to you
i cant know what exam i should take before i submit
but finally it will be a bunch of tests
well seems you know it well did you do a research something like that
what you wrote to them
ya i need a evaluation and evaluation itself needs exams
ok you must go through engineering undergrad but its free and more convenient after you graduate you could go with smp program after you graduate
i cant enroll to this because i am not a undergrad student here student member program similar to eit which is i am going to apply to
i think isnt engineering internship program it is
lol
sounds not badð and everyone has his own choice deserves to be respected for

i think i will stay the same time as you did in my place whats your plan in friday go to work
i can arrive at wednesday night and leave at friday
ya i can leave at the same time you go to work
cuz i dont know if its good to stay at your house all day by myself
i want to be there the time you could pick me i need you to bring me to your house lol
my work schedule is nothing if you want to to stay  till weekend then i can stay

sometimes i can find a car drive from ottawa to toronto
but i cant know it 2 weeks before
how much it cost you well i think i can tell by this sunday
oh ok so you have deposit there the 10 is extra money you need to pay
i can try if i can find one on that wednesday
well i found that forum i cant login anymore 2 weeks ago i couldnt login
i will tell you in 1 hr i just want to check if this forum exists anymore
i check the website i cant find any car drive on that day now probably its too early if i still cant find it that means i cant visit your house so in that case i think you can order the tickets for me because i am not sure i can find a car drive in a specific day and a specific time and for sunday morning there is unlikely a drive at such a early time
thats a good time
i am not sure i can get a car drive that day so you could book it for me now
yes
lolll
why you cant use your refund hello you sleep
thats ok i can get them for myself i will get them early next month
going to look into car drive first then greyhound

ya i already found it so its just a brochure
in this 4 days
i am going to finish my course description i think it will take me 2 days and during this time i am gonna meet some friends i havent seen my friends after i came back none of them
and i am going to learn new dishes

i am in period
ya
ya without condom lol joking but you have your word to keep ð
you said wont fuck me anymore
ok so 2 is fine
2 or 3 in july
beijing time and this month has 31 days
empathy you gonna be a good psychological doctor
no because the boss has her own schedule and this week so many people are working there
i said to my boss i will get several days break because i am going to have g1test and i am not gonna work this weekend
ya i can off work early this time
ð you could pick me up at my working place but you dont need to if you dont want
but friday night its hard to tell byward market has tons of people
lol i just finished my dinner how are your condoms
anything special
lol same size
where you see the price
12 at the bottom
ok
i think they are not cheap though
i heard there is a kind of condom made in japan its special and popular because its ultra thin
oh really
i dont know that much how do you think average dick size of japanese men
lol
you dont need to ask
there must be some statistics online you can if you want
i visited a new place
for part time working during school time
its in the rideau centre you know thai express i probably would be cashier
i am going to check my schedule and i think i can be guaranteed at least 10 hours a week
who knows if i will work there or some where else
the person i brought this bike from gave me a lock today
no i wanted to buy his lock for 10 dollars but he just gave it to me because its kind of old though
finally i can ride my bike
pulp fiction is good
i just knew a free website for downloading movies or tv series i finished it in one time so which means i am interested in that
but you can still check if there is good movies airing in movie theatres
ð i dont dare to watch its trailer but i will be fine with your company
ya i am super brave actually
i dont hate horror movies
i usually watched it with my friend in my undergrad so you dont need to worry about me i dont hide
if i say yes that is yes
lol
i dont care the reviews i want to ask you
the movies you left on my desktop are they all horror ones
ð
i dont know ð
ok whats your dinner
ya sure i miss youð­ are playing game nowð
i just finished contemplating my life as well
but i didnt go to a walk
i sat on my chair i was thinking what are the situations i am going to face after i graduate in this winter
the thing is i dont know what i am going to face i will know only if i reach it
ya
actually i am going to start job finding before my graduation
i have a question about course i was going to visit that office tomorrow i will ask her by the way
back to the topic water treatment industry still has many positions
but i dont understand why the student a year older than me cant find a professional job
and i also was thinking that i dont want to switch industry i just want to keep staying in my industry
i cant switch it easily without related solid undergrad background ya
compared to structure i think i like my environment better yes you are right
i probably will move immediately after graduation
yes i think i will find that person 2 months earlier than my leaving i will start to find
i might stay in ottawa but i cant live at downtown though
the thing is i wont move unless i know where to go i will stay in ontario but not sure and i also cant tell which specific place
i think i will choose more remote place you usually can find a job there
if i cant find a job in even more remote place i probably will start to do something not related to my industry because not many people want to go remote place
actually i dont think its too early
i mean mentally prepared
i cant do anything except the study for next semester
i am curious why you think your master is painful
yes i want to know how you feel at your lab
ok i didnt see any problem between you and your topic
you said there are two problem the first one is yourself the second one is your boss seems there is no problem with that you are not interested in your major
i didnt ask you why didnt work after your science master degree
no my question is you finished your master and then you probably could work in your industry dont necessarily work in lab do you have job that doesnt require researching
ok i think you are cool to choose soft engineering
and if you could be a game designer or something elso
you will work with your passion all day long dont need to thank me thats the truth i think you probably dont know
i usually walking on street around 3am i want to be with people who know what they want including me and some of my classmates have some trouble in their knowing their life
i have many chinese classmates i dont like them very much i am painful playing with them but i still cant jump out of this circle now
everytime i talk with them about career related things i was laughed at
no they think we cannot find a professional job during school period they dont care about what they could learn in that class they care about if they could pass this class easily with hign score
cuz i though i screw up my final i thought
so many of my classmates dont plan to find a job in environmenatal engineering so i cant find a ally for this
but i still have other classmates tough though they are incredibly diligent
there is no problem but they seemed dont usually hangout though and they are older than me
sounds good do you have friend at uottawa like your close friends in toronto
i have a white friend who is in china now and my close friend is marc
yes
yes i will i met lots if his friends but they both have children already actually i made plenty of friends in dining hall at the beginning of this semester sorry i mean last year september
this guy tried to touch my breast when we were drinking
and he asked me if i want to be his girlfriend after that night
i could make more friends next semester intentionally
yes i mean the same way talk more with people when someone start the conversation
by the way marc doesnt treat me kindly as usual after i told him i have a boyfriend lol
thats so bad but i dont care
yes i hope you have a good sleep honey
i love you too

oh i dont care if i can stay i care my job
if i cant find a decent job i will just move to a new place
did you hear someone be kicked off out of canada after graduation from graduate education
there are many ways and many kinds of people can stay in canada
trash people can stay in canada doing labour work
they can immigrate finally i know a lot
but i dont want to do labour work so i dont care about staying in canada
thank you for your concern if i can find a decent job in the future what is bootcamp
oh thank you for you suggesting i dont want to be a low level programmer all my life
it applies to people who is urgently to find a job but i am so smart so if i really want to change career i think i can do it well
my prof is trying to introduce a construction work in farm for me during my study
of course but i realized i know very less so i decided to study hard during my master i probably wont have time studying hard once i graduate
i still can get opportunities if i study hard here but after graduation no one is guiding me if i am a trash i will be a trash forever
i found my lab manager pat is really a angle and my prof is a nice guy i enjoy staying with themð
ð
hey i dont want to talk with you now
you are a shit you are very proud of your little achievement i cant anything about that
i dont care man

ohhoooo yea i love talking to advanced people like you frank
a trash is never hangout with trash

people come from china are kind of trashish ð chinese people are lazy and spoiled
hi i seriously dont have time bullshitting with you the big motherfucker
ok i like verbally fighting with you because it makes me see how dark a human being can be i like insulting people and also like be insulted by others
but since we are keeping talking nonsense and our conversation is becoming more and more meaningless

this is main problem and i also have other difficulties which all relate to my awkward situation in the sociaty
the cause of lacking friends is there is culture barrier which really needs me to push hard to break it
but i also donât have chinese friends
because keeping distance from chinese group makes me feel unsafe but i canât really love deal with this because i have the need to survive in this society
i made friends here but i feel i canât talk deeply with them and i also feel i am relatively immature and inexperienced
yeah this the realistic i am really bothered with my current boyfriend i often ignored this fact deliberately
i am wondering if i should be living in my chinese group in my entire life that is easy
i feel the respect from other mainstream people is very important i canât convince myself that they are advanced people and i asian have no chance to complete with them
i think we should be same but this is their society i am in disadvantage i think this is normal i am a newcomer after all but what makes me sad is i keep staying with chinese people automatically
which will never make me achieve my goal i need social life and i am afraid of loneliness
well you are the only reason that i am on facebook everyday
otherwise i will watch shit stuff on wechat
yea this needs to pay much more effort then others
in our department i have few people to talk about my difficulties
yesterday my boyfriend went inside my lab and the lab technician saw him saying he had an angry face
he teased me if i like cute boys like a toy no he just had no face expression
i am not sure if it is flirting he is a very warm person
he has strong emotion when talking with people very amiable he invited me to go gym with him
no about 23 times he used to invite me to go out with other 2 guys for lunch
yea
because he is this kind of people so i donât assume anything he invited to be his tenant yesterday
lab technician my boyfriend he is a kid which annoys me but he is very generous for buying me very expensive thing he has no money
he spends money in not rational way he has no income
he 100 relies on his parents and he asks for sex pretty frequently
lol is your 26 years old dick longer compared to your 20 years old one
i donât satisfy with having sex with him but i am pretty enjoy having sex with he li i wish he could come back
this is my dream
the answer is yes
ye he did
he didnât care me a shit now
why
yea i am kind of scared of meeting him but i want to meet him
the reason i am angry is he is with another girl
he is kind of happy after leaving me i guess i made him tired why i am angry is he made me extremely painful
i wanted to kill him because i can accept he marry another girl

yo skype me up
o shit
well i was just saying it sounds like my pi doesnt want to see me again it sounded like he had no more advice to give me now that i will not be walking down his career path
he absolutely worked his fucking ass off and continues to do that to this very day
i respect the shit out of the guy he and i both know that i dont have what it takes to reach his level
he gave me honest advice i think that was generous
fuck man i gotta make a better impression on people in the future i really ruined my reputation in that lab but i wasnt in the right state to be making wise decisions in that time
well i hope i dont and thats all i can do right now
i just been meeting up with my old boys and thats pretty much it
ya or in the middle of setting shit up
i am seeing some girls but not many to be honest
lol son it is an important issue theres no denying it
anything could work but peter has to leave at 5 or 6
ok thats fine peter says he eats lunch at 2 though
gotta ask peter
416 9183009
nothing at all
alright what is it i gotta be home by 8 at the latest
fucking shit dinner again
i dont really wanna spend money on dinner can we just hang normally
lets just hang normally and i will eat dinner at home whats are we going to do
i have no desire to pong
can we possibly drive somewhere else that is not niagara
are you comfortable driving
yo i am going to practice a bit of driving today cuz my sister needs to go to her firends house if you dont mind i can drive to your house after and then we can hang from there
he isnt evne online how am i gnna contact this
god damn
yo but is it still true we have to be away from 35pm is your dad doing a consult or something
so once we get to your house we will have to leave is that right
around 130 or 2
so perhaps we will drive to scarborough bluffs ror some shit and haev a chat
or even to courtice if your dad wont be there should i bring my computer
ok
like outside i dont wanna be outside for a long time u know
i was hoping we could spend some time in the car
alright we can always hang out at a mall or something as long as we arent in your vic park house for those 2 hours
i already told him to go to your house around 1302 and thath e dont need to drivem e there
yes
cuz i will be in the area
lol in case you force me to stay outside in the cold
fucking shit boy
ok
not really a full letter last year my pi told me to give him some stuff to say about me tell me what you need son
sorry son i dont have a sample letter but i can give you some general tips
basically you would start with   dear x  it is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for frank wang i have known frank for 3 years as his masters degree supervisor at ubc   then you write some positive shit about yourself  summarize the above points considering his   and  i highly recommend frank without reservation   sincerely professor x
ok but this letter is coming from your masters pi right
ok so she might not know your coding but she can talk about your resaerch experience talk about communication skills oral and written and presentation teamwork
dedication hard work
ok then talk about that too but you need to emphasize the teamworkcommunication too
maybe 1 paragraph on those soft skills and 1 paragraph on your technical lab ability and the fact that you are a quick and dedicated learner it is all bullshitting artistry
yes son but dont just say general sentences give examples if possible
you are welcome
i am almost certainly going to china but i will be in toronto for part of summer for sure
likely the beginning and the end and the middle i will go to china and hopefully also asia trip
lol well i hope we can hang out in japan
what the fuck why is that cuz you are working
dude i suggest you to ask the pi if you can take a break cuz my pis were open to that before
i dont know but i am guessing potentially late in the summer
ie early or mid august or perhaps early summer
i can be flexible about japan time provided you are gonna come with me honestly the only time i will ever visit japan in my lifetime is probably if you go with me
the school might be able to help pay some of it
no for the china trip the rest of the money will come from my own funds my bank loans
i wanna do it on the cheap side but honestly i have a lot of bank credit so the price isnt that critical its abtout the experiece
ya go talk to them about it i am dead serious about a japan trip frank this isnt just bullshitting here
yes i am don
normally i would agree you are wasting  your money to go to a place you already been but from talking to you i know that you dont care about travelling anywhere else in the world but japan
i am surprised to hear that but i think you will have more fun if you go with friends
and i am not 100 set on fucking girls when we travel so dont let that sway your decision
if you wana travel as monks thats fine with me as long as we can travel
lol god damn i am gonna be thirsty as fuck when i return from that kind of monk trip
lol those sources might exist in japan but if you insist on being a monk i will respect it but you know part of travelling to a foreign country is to take in their culture
lol it is just an arguemnt to be made it dont represent my views
lol ya i read about that too japan has some real population issues
nah son i have no allegiance to japan for me its just an interesting country and culture to visit
i dont have the same kind of history as you
yo
ask you parents about this next time they see you wont you or next time you guys talk rather
ok later
uh i dont really think thats appropriate
ok well i cant plan it right now because i dont know when im going on my exchange but i will find out in early march will that be okay with you
alright ill let you know
i am doing my exchange in sichuan after that i am down to trave lelsewhere in china andor around asia
yes son in fact it is the hospital i was born in going back to the crib
ya that sounds like a plan except to be honest i dont want to go to beijing but i would want togo to hon kong or shanghai
ya ok we will figure out the details later
ya sure son we can go on separate trips to china and then meet up somewhere after we are done our own business
ya one last ride
son im in peru and my internet is not reliable but ask it up
probably not the boot camp is on a separate part of the hard drive also 1068 is damn old they have 1011 or 12 now i think
go to apple menu check for system updates or you can go to apple store and upgrade should be free i have to turn off my phone cuz im on a plane right now
lol i wont be doing that shit today is my last day in peru and we are gonna take it easy it is hot as fuck here
lol maybe when we go to japan we can do that
yes i am still using it but i am not using sierra right now currently i am sitll on yosemite
my comp is definitely slower than it was before but its real old going on 7 years so its to be expected also if your hard drive is very full  it can slow down your comp
ok yo talk to me on skype if you wanna chat more i am going off fb
yo i am here what do you need
yo you want to chat on fb from now on or on skype anyway thats great news man you gotta tell me more about her specifically next time you should go for it
can we move to skype actually
i feel like its more secure than facebook
nice that sounds like a great plan
you can thank me if it goes well im glad my research is useful
just stuff i read on the internet mostly like ask reddit or relationship advice on reddit
well its user base is mostly young people and you get the general consensus on things there so for relationships i think its not a bad source of advice because it tells you the most common thoughts and attitudes
thats probably not bad either but might be more for adults
congratulations frank thats a good step good luck with it
lol im glad it turned out good son did you guys go to the art gallery yet
alright well have fun man
lol you fucking made it happen dude so you should be very pleased with yourself right in the nick of time too since the years almost over
just focus on making it work son
tell me about it then im going june 10august 4
you told me you were at a lab in toronto right
thats great news man we will hang out in early june before i leave
how was your date at the art gallery son
not before then i have school until june 2ish
well thats great sounds like a mutual attraction i think that will make things easier for you guys
did you make any moves i dont think you have much to lose by being more aggressive but nothing wrong with taking it slow
damn son thats pretty intense already pledging to visit each other
i think you should be aggro next time youve already been on 3 dates and she seems into you
do you guys speak in english or chinese
maybe you can fuck her if she visits you
oh shit are you fucking serious about the molestation thing if thats the case then maybe you should play it slow
she is too low level because she is fucking someone in a short time span to be honest i think thats normal for young adults in this day and age
forget about her man clearly she has some different values than you
its a good thing in the long run that you didnt date her
you sound happy to be with that girl so thats a great thing
yo
i know this is a very private question but what exactly did she tell you about the molestation i think your next play depends on that
ok i think you can still go aggro but not too hard you can hold her hand and kiss her on the cheek next time you dont wanna remind her of that traumatic episode
wtf is that
lol ya i guess so im only guessing based on what you told me that she might appreciate that but some girls would consider that to be too chicken
no problem man im looking forward to hearing more about this girl
are you serious
i hear the girls are fine enjoy yourself
its not bad we are heading into exams so the next 3 weeks are gonna be going hardcore i will be back in toronto for a week after exams
and then we got discovery week where we go learn in a small ontario community after that i will be back in toronto for another week then i am off to china
5
actually we have one this friday which is a midterm then we have 5 finals so its kind of like 6
there is less pressure now but still some i actually nearly failed one of my midterms so i have to go extra hardcore on that course to make sure i pass it
ya thanks son i know what i gotta do i just gotta do it
it truly aint that difficult nobody would claim its difficult to be honest there might be a high volume of work but it is straightforward work
discipline is much more useful than intelligence right now to be honest though i need to improve my discipline
lmao you caught me son
oh really tell me about it son
lool
alright ill hear it later
i am out as well later dude
go for it son
if it were most girls i think she wants the d but in this case im not too sure
lmao how many nights are you gonna sleep over
you should bring some condoms just in case seriously speaking
respect her space but if she makes moves then you should go for it you dont have to tell her you brought it unless she asks if she asks then its clear she wants it
alright np have fun in vegas
i got an exam tomorrow but remind me tomorrow afternoon
yo son
i just passed my exam
i am pretty sure i passed and i think i did pretty good but there were a few questions i got wrong anyway you still in vegas
what the fuck sarcasm does not work in text
ok
ya i downloaded them i am gonna read them in a few min
lol that sounds like hell son what did you guys do there
did your whole family go or just you and your mom
you didnt go gamblin  i thought thats the whole reason ppl go to vegas
man
then you hardly went to vegas to went to nevada you went to nevada
god damn thats really misleading
i hear alaska is a great place for a cruise but its extremely expensie did you take some nice picture
you gota show me next time man
i am gonna be back for several days in late may after our exams and before our clinical experience week
may 19 to 25 approximately
not yet man i will read them right now
dude lets go on skype
no i dont think so she told me she met you today
no man it was not her she is too pro for me
she is extremely organized and disciplined and her attitude in life is to go hard at all times like she plans her breaks and is never idle which is very different from my habits
you think i should have gone for it
yes she is
well she has had boyfriends before just not right now i think tina is a very high quality waifu
whats up son
not much but when we do talk on facebook she types a lot i wouldnt make anything out of it dude and youre already dating someone else
no i didnt but i can ask her are you still at sick kids today
lol when are you going home
i am thinking of going to meet tina right now i can hang with you later or you can even join us if you want
just gonna meet up and chat i think
right now im going to meet her at tgh in a few minutes when are you going to join us
ok well ill let you know what we end up doing and you can come by
were on the third floor of pgcrl on the benches near the auditorium
oh lol really
well if you are so into that book can you share with me those excerpts that made you so inspired
alright i will give you some time
youre right about that it probably wouldnt have been possible for you to convince me to read the book i usually dont read entire book based on recommendations
thats a very interesting passage thanks for sharing it i have to admit i feel like for whatever reason i definitely lean much closer to the entity theory
hell yes nigger and thank you for taking the time to type that for me i do appreciate you sharing and i am going to keep those 2 theories in mind next time i think about myself
im researching how to get chinese booty i had 3 different hot girls guide me around yesterday and today but i wasnt able to seduce them
they are all domestic medical students one is from chengdu and the other two were from other parts of china
lmao frank you crazy
i aint gonna date them and i have no idea how to casually hook up with them cuz i dont know the commute culture
the girl from chengdu had good english the other two had quite poor english for them they can read english very well but have a hard time with verbal communication these students read literal papers in english
she is hot by classical chinese standards but i personally dont find her that hot how the fuck can i bring her back she has no citizenship and is still studying here
lmao your fucking crazy dude i dont know how to ask her if she wants something to remember me by
lmao you are honestly fucking hilarious dude thats not bad advice either and the problem is its hard to be confident speaking a language that im not fluent in
you know this whole thing goes back to my speech about intellectualism because when i interact with people its about having an interesting intellectual conversation
l m a o holy shit frank you are too fucking funny these days honestly you know what i got a very funny story to tell you i downloaded an app called momo to meet some girls in china
lol well you see i considered it but it was expensive and i didnt want to risk getting caught by the police in a foreign country its possible that she is an undercover police
ya that aint gonnah appen to me
none i read an aticle about dating and sex culture in china and its vastly diffeent
lol wtf my sleep schedule is just messed up im out now though later
i can talk a bit right now but i gotta go soon are you there
well ask me the questions you have offline and i will answer them when i have internet
the new macs all have tiny hard drives so itll be difficult to install partition
but its possible if you use an external hard drive to store most of your files
personally i like mac so i would probably still get a mac
idk why theyre reducing space i dont think windows laptops should break down unless you are not taking care of it
playing games makes it hot and if you make it too hot too much it can damage the hardware that would happen to macs too if you are gonna game you should get a cooling pad
ya external
i aint sure son i heard you can buy copper plates and put them on your mac to cool it down
ya good luck i stopped following computers since undergrad so i dont know much anymore
you should ask stefan about it he can refer you to kevin bender who knows his shit
is not bad i gotta go to work now
ive seen it before in some gameplay maybe ill watch a play through
i just arrived in lhasa today with my sister well be in tibet for 4 days then back to chengdu
yes now its just travel and meet family and family friends and shit

i just passed my scuba exam
coming home tomorrow i would like to play on saturday or sunday the 2627
ok ill let you know if anything changes but i think its ok
i prefer not because i have my g test in lindsay in the afternoon i will be home at like 5 or 6 and that wont leave us with much time i want to play the whole day
i dont mind coming to your house on sunday to play if that means that we can play for a long time like at least 6 hours or at least 2 full games
lol have you ever brought your ass to lindsay that place aint exactly easy
it aint like that no more son
ya also i passed my g2 at vicpark so dont act all pro
lol you motherfucker i hope i pass that shit i paid 200 to buy that spot from a chinese instructor because there were no spots available anywhere in fucking ontario because i booked too late
thanks frank yo so is it sunday or friday
like do i have a choice in the matter ok
are you driving there
yo like i got no problem with friday night but i just wanna play til late if you guys can all play til late thats fine with me i dont want you to drive unsafely to ottawa
i will be home around 5 or 6pm by my estimation i am willing to stay until 11 pm or so on friday if the others are too then its fine
yes you can crash at my place
you can bring some spare clothes and your toothbrush you have to shower before you sleep in my bed thats my only requirement
you need to make sure the other two players are willing to stay late as well then
ok
now where are we gonna play til 12am it cant be at my house
yes it will be open all day long 247
tell adelle to make it for 6pm cant you tell her that no last time we played 5 hours i thought
and we played until only 5pm i thought we played until 730
god damn i swear this is going to make me want to play mahjong a third time 5 hours aint enough to satisfy me
what time would that be i can accept friday
god damn
and what time can we play until on sunday
ok dude lets just do friday then thats only 1 more hour plus we gotta break to eat lunch
so it will be better to do friday
it is actually sanford fleming i think
actually i aint sure anyway they know hwere it is
i will leave the decision up to you i can make both days work but please tell me in the next couple of days
if she cna only do 1 game then we gotta play mahjong a third time but i am certainly willing to play just one game better than not playing
why not son
lmao ok man well i will take any jong i can get its like pussy you cant be too picky
ok
ok are you going to sleep over at my house
ok
yes thats fine
im good everything cool son
are we still on for 630
actually i finished on wednesday i got a stand by in lindsay
i can make 630 no problem
i already made plans to play magic with some magic buddies im meeting them right now
i passed the driving test my boy
we are playing in bahen but i think the table in bahen are not ideal for mahjong sf is open
do you want to grab food before mahjong
maybe just the burrito place on college
yeah i like it but we can go anywhere nearby
sure we might play 4 man format but we can swap out we are meeting at 2pm bahen
yo frank how are things in ottawa man today i saw your associate meagan thang on cmb and damn shes quite fine
we did not meet man i saw her on cmb
 coffee meets bagel a dating app
you gotta know that shit by now son
yo do u mind talking on skype
sure
what can i do for you
i will look at it this evening
yo
get on skype
i am gonna tell u about your cv
yo
what do you mean by that i want to see japans cities and culture and taste their food and i also want to see their natural environments
but why is that
oh really ya i am thinking about doing some travelling over winter
but if you think japan is not the right place to go then we can try to do japan another tim
ok well what do you think man if you can go this summer that would be ideal but we are both free during the winter for sure
ok that might be a good time for me too
i do not intend on splurging i just want to see the sights and occasionally enjoy good food
that is kind of shit though i wouldnt mind it but i think japans natural sights are beautiful too anywa y i will take your recommendation
ok so should we plan to go to japan this winter then or should we plan for august
ok i should be free at that time too
no i have literally no idea what im doing this summer
ya shadowing
nah its all for cv building to show your interest in a certain specialty but as i said i have no idea what i want to do this summer i gotta go cook some shit son
yo actually i made curry but i tried a variation on the recipe i used green beans instead of onions cuz i think it would be more nutritious
lmao actually yes i have as you might know i really enjoy teachin and travelling and currently i am trying to see if i can work with the exchange program people in china to improve their exchange program
yo i am fine
still no girls but no complaints otherwise tell me about your life
o shit
tell me about it
what does the company do
and whats your job there
god damn congratulations frank not everyone gets a coop but you did it
whats the work schedule like
ya of course wait wtf thats much earlier than i thought
i thought in may until august
oh i see
looks like the japan trip is a real possibility
i am gonna have to try and make it work on my end
meng did say he would be interested in japan peter is interested too and i dont mind going with him i am concerned his idea of a trip is gonna be too different from my idea of a trip
oh i see perhaps you are right when i went to france with meng he was a flexible person to travel with he basically followed all my original plans so that made things easier
i doubt it peter is stubborn he is gonna want to ball out while im more interested in seeing the sights and taking beautiful pictures and eating authentic food
ok i will try a nice restaurant but not every day
i heard japan is a very expensive travel destination
fucking shit son
are there no cheap hostels
as long as it has a hot shower and no bug infestation i think thats fine
the transit is very good in japanese cities isnt it
so it probably dont matter if we are living a bit far
we gotta go to the pinsaro man
she aint coming with us is she
you mean your appetite is always satisfied or you have no appetite
i see thats too bad
ive been watching some japanese porn recently
they got some crazy ideas there are some subreddits dedicated to them
they have some unusual concepts or premises quite creative
anyway we dont have to do sex tourism in japan i was only half serious
yo i dont wanna lose my money
thats unacceptable
i aint made of money
if we go as 4 we can just play among ourselves for fun and btw jamie said he would be interested in learning maj
perhaps we can play in winter he is getting more in touch with his chinese culture lately
yes
she was in lmp
she is hot as hell but not very nice she is med same year as me
ya
how did you hear about her how is that gg i aint gonna hit her up
wow thats ancient history chloe is fucking intense i believe she wants to do neurosurgery
lmao she awakened the beast eh
it is not bad i am trying a bit harder this semester and i got some positive feedback on my trying harder so far so that is motivating me to continue trying harder
yesterday in our small group i was the only one who read the case beforehand and i looked up words that i didnt know
today we had did some learning in the hospital about elderly patients and i was the only one who did the prereadings so i knew about a certain test to look for dementia and i successfully did the test
and again the professor was impressed they aint slackers most are smarter than me
to be honest i think i got almost no positive feedback last year
well they aint slackers in the sense they focus on the lecture materials yes the readings were suposed to be done but many students tend to focus on the lecture material
thanks frank i do feel good about it
and that motivation is important for me
ya i certainly hope so
well it aint like they are gonna stop learning
and i dont wanna make the mistake of feeling better than my classmates so i aint gonna shit talk them
ya thanks for the encouragement man i am gonna keep at it
lmao thats fucked up dude
showing me your girlfriends shoulder
lol she wants to be shown off
lol its not hard to accept its just surprising where are you
god damn yo are you going home
gonna spend the whole week fucking around
sounds like youre busy
this week is pretty heavy i got several early mornings i am doing an observership tomorrow in neurology gonna take up most of the day
well thats certainly a goal lmao if you recognize its a drug maybe you shouldnt get addicted to it
meng bao of all people told me the other day that he realized he shouldnt try to be pro at games he should just get pro at life
he just plays games for fun these days yeah that line really struck me i respect the guy for saying it
yeah i remember that fact about the game its a fucking shame
lol have fun son talk to you later
yo this week is a heavy one i got shit starting at 830 or 800am for 4 days in a row tuesday to friday and that shit is already killing me i gotta wake up at 6 tomorow
lmao nah it is busy like todays class was 830 to 5 that is unusually busy for us
it is variable as i said this week was unusually busy
we have different clinical skills classes and recently i have been having a ton so i am busier than others but they will have those classes a bit later
anyway whas happening to you
damn dude
im sorry to hear that frank what exactly happened that caused you guys to break up
that makes sense that you would come to know more about her so it sounds like you are not surprised by the breakup who initiated it
alright it sounds like theres a lot going on what did you parents tell you about her
right i see what you are saying but you told me that sarah was the one to initiate the breakup so it seems that she was also feeling dissatisfied with the relationship is that right
i can see that you did look like you enjoyed being with her during that time but you are also telling me that you found it hard to regard her as a longterm romantic interest
alright we dont have to talk about it now you should know its normal to get emotional even more than you expected when it comes to changes in a relationship dont be too hard on yourself
maybe you can take a few days and see how your outlook changes and we can talk again
ya no problem man
yo im on the subway now got back to toronto and my friend dropped me off at islington im glad to hear that let me know if you wanna talk about it
no its my moms birthday
so i gotta go home and see her since my dad is gone
lmao yes i am son lmao i dont think ill say that to be honest she would find it weird
the whole thing
she might find it funny but she might also find it weird
lol i aint gonna do that man i mean would your mother think it weird if i wished her happy birthday
yes i knew that you gonna meet her
my dad tried to subtly imply that i should date tina
yeah she certainly is
lmao
i think you shouldnt tell her i said that btw
my father said some good things about her then he later asked me what i think of her and he aint never asked me that kind of question before
he met her briefly when he dropped me off at the airport because tina was gonna drive me back to windsor and she wanted to meet at the airport
he was impressed by her independence since she is living in canada by herself since undergrad
and she managed to get into med school
my father worships med school
man what your parents said is kind of wrong i thin k and i can tell you i currently have no plans to hit up tina hypothetically if she hit me up i could probably not refuse
but as i told you i have had some deep chats with her about life and she is looking for stability and a mature guy to support her and i cant offer what she is looking for
i dont think i made a mistake with marina frank it was only hypothetical that i considered if i had made a mistake but i dont think i did
haha ya you do that hopefully you guys can meet up
im sure you can find good people if you keep looking you gotta know theres thousands of students there and they all have different values you join any clubs besides game design
i never finished it i completed about 40 of the game but i never felt the urge to continue it
however the time that i played the game i really enjoyed it because i need to log on to steam and my computer is getting slow i never log onto steam for other easons it is a wellmade game
i forgot to mention i got stuck at a part and thats a reason i didnt keep playing
it is a more difficult game than portal i mean it gets more difficult the beginning is easy but the design and story is not quite as engaging as portals
however its still well done
the story is told through readings and voice recordings and it seems to be about artificial intelligence from what i could tell so faar
if you are looking for a game like portal this is a great choice oh shit how much did it cost
tell me about it
thats a great price what else did  you buy
i mean 10 is a great price
ok wait do you have the witness
god damn
are  you fucking serious i wanted to play that shit
ya that would be great its been a long time since we gamed together
thats a shame
i see have you played any good modern games recently like published in the last year or 2
ok you should try prey
ok i just heard its a good game man t
it is horror and you love that stuff oh gg
thats a shame dude firewatch was nice did you ever play life is strange
chill man i watched it on youtube but the sequel was released recently you might wanna check it out
ok
recently i taught my windsor friends how to play magic with my cube i still think magic is the greatest game ever made
no none of them were
but several of them played hearthstone so that drove their interest
yes it is like sorceryspeed only magic with warcraft charactrs
lol ya it is bullshit
no they sued another game called hex for being too similar but hearthstone is not that similar in gameplay
but it is another card game
it is still a great dream i have that one day you will return to playing magic with us like old times money aint the issue it once was it is a dream man
oh really why is that that weekend there is a magic tournament in london but remember i am in windsor not london so i wont see you unless i go that magic tournament
i see so youll be in london not windsor
its 2 hours
not sure might come back the same day because its only a day perhaps i can carpool with people
alright well keep me updated i might go to london that weekend the girls at western are incredibly fine
especially the young white girls and the tinder scene in western is full of young girls
oh really you dont need dat pussay
damn dude maybe your change your mind in the future
yo talk to me frank tell me whats happening with you
im gonna go wash dishes but keep telling me about it
yeah that looks very realistic what kind of game you have in mind
how about a room escape game those take place in a single room
that is true if you wanna make a plot game it might be hard
there is a game that takes place in one house but not just one room
i think it was called gone home it was pretty well known a few years ago
ya you should it is similar to dear esther so you got some vr skills now how did u learn that shit
that sounds really cool man how are they gonna do it like have an empty room but giv everyone vr headsets will it be single player or coop
but how can you avoid bumping into people
and how do you stop bumping into the wal
thats fucking cool as hell man so you dont even need a large room
you can keep each player in a tiny little prison cell sized room
how much money is that gonna save compared to a real escape room
well ive been to many escape rooms probably more than 5 or 6 its true the components were not always in the best shape
and the immersion wasnt that great ive been only to toronto rooms there are tons of escape rooms in toronto man like at least 10
lmao honestly you have a fantastic memory anyway i always have fun going to them
but they are expensve perhaps if vr rooms are cheaper that can be a great way to get business you will recoup the cost of the headset very quickly
and you dont need to pay a real person to reset the rooms puzzles yo how did you get involved with this project you seem to really be putting yourself out there
thats unfortunate but at least you got some experience
do you find that when you giv people your c v they value your msc even though its in an unrelated field
what experience like he had an msc too
oh ok well its great that those 2 years havent gone to waste for you
now that you got your foot in the door
you should be able to keep going up
when is your cop starting
where is it gonna be i forgot
holy shit by transit or drive
why dont you bring a car to ottawa
i think it would make your life easier
yo i am doing fine it was a good weekend for me so far on friday my friends and i had a hotpot then we played avalon after its a hidden role game similar to mafia or werewolf
we played for probably 3 hours well not all my weekends are like this
sometimes i feel like shit and just waste the entire time but i feel somewhat accomplished or at least social this weekend
ya hell ya i am the fucking master of that
you guys are still on good terms
im glad to hear it i surf reddit a lot sometimes i watch magic on twitch or pubg and i also watch tv and movies
you know pubg
player unknowns battlegrounds it is like battle royale and counterstrike
it looks fun as fuck son lemme tell you ya its pc currently beta it looks so much fucking fun but sadly i cant run it
my mac is functioning fine for everthing nongaming so it feels like a waste to buy a new computer just so i can gam and next year i think i will have no time to survive but frank
lol it doesnt have to be at 401 it can be online games son or even magic at someones house
it is the greatest game of all time i hope i never have to give it up
haha man i just wanna spend time with my old buddies playing games thats all im saying i hope we can live in the same city when we are older
ya man i love nostalgia and i love you man
i prefer toronto man i will try my best to get there
ya
ya thats the ky to life i guess being happy with whatever you are dealt
nope nothing like that man i am still on coffe meets bagels and tinder and shit
well perhaps i made the wrong choice there but i thought i consulted your opinion about it and you ageed with me
alright well unfortunately what is done is done i would have give her another chance if i was still in toronto
but it was the end of summer and that was a factor in my decision
i dont remember clearly right now i think it might have been about books or her choice to study english or something i think its better if we dont talk about that girl too much
i mean you dont seem to have anything relevant to say just that it might have been a mistake and theres nothing i can do to act on this information
i dont remember it clearly to be honest but i was impressed with the girl cuz she communicated clearly a lot of girls on cmb grew up in china so their english abilities are not excellent
some internationals yes
honestly you would be successful on cmb i think tinder is pretty shit too many white girls who dont wanna be with an asian guy
there are tons of asians and you are higly educated
you can do it i remember your old okc profile you got some traction o that site
oho you gonna show me
i think youre right
yo hello we didnt get to talk about this yesterday but i wantd to ask you how you were doing after the breakup
ya i mentioned some concern before you moved in with her but im glad you are living together in a civil fashion
you can install a chrome extension that lets you run apk files android app files on your computer
i am getting tons of matches recently
but i notice i never match with the most beautiful girls i always get the slightly unattractive ones
lol gg dude thats pretty much out of my control
i got enough girls on my plate man
lol
damn dude i dont have any truly beautiful matches i saw this one girl who was 1010 she was another u of t med student but she didnt match me so my fantasy was crushed
im surprised you like a white girl frank yo tell me about the demographics in ottawas cmb what percentage is white and asian
l ooo  l same over here with the obese white girls
but theres tons of asian girls on this appp like 90
ya thats right
just set your location its in the options
in the app setting
the same place you edi t your profile
not that pic i forgot but just dig around
ya i mean so far i have gotten only that 1 date over the summer with cmb but i will ask them on a date on a weekend that i am back in toronto and thats that
lol its just convenient since i barely know these girls i cant be bothered to make a trip back just for them
which the white girl
she is fine looking what is her occupation
what else is in her profile
maybe she just wants the d
seeing as she is giving people nothing else to judge her on besides her physical appearance
you seem interested hopefully she matches you
lol how did she see it
she just walks into your room with no warning
well it seems to be  cool among ou guys
nah man aint nobody broke up 2 of them are married and several others are in long term relationships
ya it sure does
lol everyone wastes time or spends it doing something they find fun if thats youtube for you aint nothing worng with it
lol later son
l o l you ran into her
no i havent maybe she is a new user and i will have the luck of running into her you gonna swipe right on her
l m a o theres nothing i can do to hurry man lol each day the program gives you a batch of girls to choose from and you cant control who the program suggests to you
looool nah i aint afraid of  you son
lol i welcome the competition then we havent competed like this since undergrad
ya i know you were trolling me man lol
you trying to get me in a rage
lol you are trying to tempt me
lmao you say the funniest things man lots of girls i have seen on online dating explicitly mention it especially the asian girls
i think what they mean is they want a boyfriend with money
i have heard some very negative things about mainland chinese girls especially when it comes to dating
they consider it as an exchange of their sexual goods for the males financial goods girls who came here late
the girls who came early or grew up here probably buy more into the western mindset of love and shit michelle is very conservative i think cuz she grew up in singapore and they got some draconian laws there
death penalty for dealing drugs get in deep shit for spitting gum on the street
yes harsh as hell if you traveling there you best not bring drugs even for your own enjoyment
whats weird about her mindset
hell son i want to marry a girl with big money
lmao it aint for sure probably overestimate doctor money people
anyway all im saying is thats not at all an uncommon mindset
not necessarily
it would be immature to judge people based only on that
she should pick me i will give her all the money in exchange for her goods
oh damn son you are right in that case i got nothing to offer
haha thats probably true you have a wider range of possible income but you might need some luck to reach the upper limits
yo make it happen son we can buy our own private island with a huge harem
yo son you gotta read this shit and tell me what you think japan got some interesting things happening httpswwwtheatlanticcomhealtharchive201711payingforfakefriendsandfamily545060
yo im pretty sure that when people describe you as more jap than china its because of your interests not your behavioral i didnt know that shit happened in your home town
it might be due to your look its rare for chinese to have facial hair and your hairstyle is more jap
dude you did have facial hair for a long time no we are trained not to do that shit son
that is literally the opposite of the ethics they teach us
you used to have a bit of a moustache and a beard
we deliver the info but we dont necessary say it literally straight up there is a procedure for it
dude it is not sugarcoating but there is a level of controlling how you give that info
but that is completely different from that acting in japan that stuff is 100 lying to somebody
yes isnt that obvious to you
lol you dont fucking know dude you ever had someone tell you some bad news you cant even imagine what it would be like to receive bad news in different ways
yo lemme just give you an example of how you would give someone the bad news cuz i dont think you are understanding it properly
lets say you did a test and found someone got cancer and you gotta tell them that
so you would say something like do you know why we are meeting today yes its because you did a test last time to see what is causing you these problems we got the test results back today would you like to hear them ok we found that you have pancreatic cancer wait for them to react discuss it further
it depends on their reaction but you would want to clarify any questions they have about the cnacer
as you can see the info is delivered straight up but  you are doing some prep before you deliver the news to avoid any misunderstandings and that method is supported by peer reviewed research
you mgiht not have a problem at all with how we do it in medicine then we aint into lying to people its fine to lie to the person who hired you that is like hiring a prostitute
but you cant blame the institution for the lies that some practitioners might engage in
when you first read the article were you surprised or felt any strong emtion
i was surprised as fuck that such a business could exist
i condemn them for taking jobs where they must lie to other people besides the person who hired them but i think its perfectly fine to have this business and lie to the customers only
lol i trust them
give it time man
ya like michelle i still havent seen her
nah there are just a ton of girls in toronto who want the d
lol you might be right
lol well i dont pay for it so it aint working on me i am willing to put up with whatever service they are willing to offer for free
dude if you dont perceive a difference intuitively then i dont know what to tell you i can keep arguing with you here i can tell you that a purchase is ultimately your decision
well you are fucking wrong dude and i am pretty sure youre only trying to start an argument i already explained to you why lying to the daughter is way different from sales
i hope i expanded on it enough for your satisfaction but i dont think im going to change my mind on this
no i explained it differently several times i talked about the magnitude of the lie then the expectation
i am not condemning the actor in every case only in the specific case of being the girls father on her mothers request that is the only scenario listed in the article that i thought was unethical
windsor or toronto
that aint my town and i wont be there im going home to toronto tonight
no i just wanna take a break
my friends driving
no andrew lechman
yo yes it was fun i met up with some buds we playd a bit of magic and we ate dinner at dennys
and i also ate with family twice
paul han and alex aroella you might know alex back from first year
yes
how was london
thats great man yes i am in contact with stefan we talk about once a week or so
but i havent physically seen him since summer he doesnt like to hang out in person much or perhaps he cant
lmao tell me about her
thats nice you made a new friend man she looks pretty good too how did the competition go
well she goes to western it seems she seems far fromyou
ya of course you made a pet game
and did you win the prize
thats the cost of working in a team and i see your teammate nick crawford he seems like an ass
he says in his biography that he did the hardest parts of the project
you dont even have one
o sh i tt ttttt lol
ya  you kind of are man
you are taking credit for yourself but you should always appear to be generous to your teammates in a professional setting even if its true you shouldnt say it was the hardest part
wow so you never met them irl beore
did you work together irl during the hackathon
thats cool man
did you stay up for 27h in a row
that is fucking intense its cool that compsci has these events for students to meet new people and work together
we have something like this
its called ontario medical students weekend omsw you get the ontario med students together for a weekend of workshops and socials i went to it last year and it was real fun
ya
we have another one that is a sports competition but i didnt go last year that one i all about getting drunk is all about you should keep going man you will make good business connections
just keep in mind that others are going for connections and your future colleagues or employers might be observing your actions
no you are fucking wrong about that you dont have to socialize beyond your comfort but you do have to show basic respect and social skills to people you meet
because employers may red flag you if they notice you are too antisocial
ya i know you do i am just making sure you are aware of how important this shit is
ya thats true
but in a larger organization like one that youll probably be working in it takes a lot more time to notice incompetence than unfriendliness usually people arent discarded because they are unskilled because theres a higher tolerance for that
thats fine man i am just saying that i hear compsci is quite a cooperative field
alright well i think you will definitely see whats up in coop
ya that is very open not totally abnormal though
l o l ok well thats not necessarily inconsistent with offering you to use her houses shower but i agree its not totally in line either
you think she wanted the d is that what you are trying to say
did you go to her house to shower
honestly i could see it both ways man did she offer other people to come over and shower
like did she offer you to sleep at her house or only to use the shower
ya honestly i dont fucking know i aint the right guy to ask about this hsit
when are you back in toronto
how crazy you wanna do cocaine
lol damn that would be a callback but we will need more people
there was none when i left but on the road back it started snowing
but there was none actually on the ground
but in a months time there iwll probaby be snow i want to play mahjong son
lol it is my last christmas ever i want to make sure its a special one god damn my last christmas ever at the age of 25 i didnt know i would only get 25 christmases in my life
l o l you are a true friend frank i hope it wont come to that but i mean i tink it is truly the last time in my life i will have 2 weeks off for christmas
i might be able to have a couple days in the future but nothing compared to 2 weeks until retirement
you are gonna be the same way man that is the reality of working life
good night man
ya i already saw this the cards generated range from completely nonsense to actual functioning correctly cards
itll never be as good as human designers but it might inspire human designers
are they not replying to you or not matching you
are the girls mostly white
oh really is your location ottawa or toronto
hmm im not sure it was like that for me too at the beginning do you have good pictures
and a good profile
so they matched you son
lmao how do you know they liked you if you guys didnt marc match
oh i see i rarely get those
well clearly you are attracting some girls so its a start if they are too ugly then you are right to pass on them
man if you say they are ugly perhaps they truly are ugly cuz i know you are pretty generous with evaluating looks
well i dont know what to tell you son i got many matches in the past couple of years but only one i ever met irl this shit takes massive volumes
l o l dude because you dont just say that to girls unless you are 100 sure they are interested in casual sex
lmao i guess youre right she is graduating this year and she wants to do a dental residency so its an unstable time i doubt she would agree to date me
lol thats a great observation but i know lots of people in unstable relationships and they seem to be going fine like a girl in my class goes to toronto very often to see her boyfriend
and marina dated her boyfriend for 3 years while he was in toronto and she was at mac
yes but nobody wants to take the plunge and reasonably do so also if you are seen to be putting disproportionate effort the other person might see you as desperate or clingy theres no winning here man
i have no idea what you mean dude
ok well i hope i got my point across recently my mother told me i gotta get a girlfriend she offered to introduce me to some girls
i refused her offer so i aint sure she said she knows some nice girls but honestly i dont believe her
yeah absolutely also im pretty sure my mom actually just doesnt know anything
anyone
lmao no i aint gonna go into that shit as soon as i show some interest she will never let it go and i dont wanna tell my mother about my physical preferences thats awkward as fuck
i got nothing in mind right now except that it looks quite unlikely for me to find a girlfriend anytime soon and i will not accept my mothers offer unless i am totally desperate
lol i think cmb has by far the most wholesome population of girls
i need a friend to hook me up with some nice girl i dont know any irl
nobody right now to be totally honest michelle is the closest you can get but thats mostly jokes i think she is attractive and is intelligent and has a great career but i dont know her well personally to be attracted to her personality
yes
i know many of them somewhat well they have good personality features but i dont feel anything special about them personality wise
i am just as confused my dude you are the expert here
lmao true
lol damn man i dont know either
lol you should be telling me dude its hard to observe yourself
expand on those
lol you mentioned both those points before and you are 100 correct but i dont know if im ready to change those things im certainly not gonna compromise on being picky
yeah i take them as indicator of certain values but its not a definite indicator anyway honestly the single biggest problem for me right now is being in windsor
theres just a smaller dating pool here and the online dating apps are populated almost entirely by white girls who never swipe on me
thats true
later
good for you man you gonna chat her up ive been feeling less interested in cmb lately
lol well i get a few matches every now and then and we talk but it is boring i always end up talking about the same things to all the girls
lol the girls that i match with tend  to be very shy some of them show no interest they only answer my question and ask it back at me
tina already analyzed herself
she told me she has a very wide variety of interests so she finds it easy to connect with anyone
but i actually dont think thats true tina is kind of an elite person and she certainly doesnt appreciate certain kinds of people in our class with whom she has nothing in common
however the girls on online dating are on average only the average person
and honestly i aint looking for an average girl
i said the girls are on average average michelle brings up that average and there are girls who bring it down
yup
ya honestly its a tough business to break into especially if you are picky
jesus christ
lol she is a nice person but she has some faults there are a small number of people in our class who she feels like she has nothing in common wtih
not financially but they may have more mainstream interests in rap music for example
lol yes she tries to hide it and doesnt go crazy but you can tell and ya i guess most people have mainstream tastes
lol to be honest i doubt that you told me your ex sometimes went crazy and you couldnt deal with that shit
that is fucked up son
haha i just checked it and all my convos are expired now so i have a fresh start once i get some more matche
the girls were hot but we didn talk about anything interesting
nah man i never said none were hot some are some are less
lol none of them are insanely hot and i still havent seen michelle on there yet
lol she probably wont give a shit son oh i just thought of something perhaps the cmb algorithm wont suggest matches to you if you have more than a certain number of fb friends
you too son
im fine just finished an exam on friday i am just chilling so far but theres tons of work to do before winter break
what about u
when is that coming out
wow thats a long long time im surprised it was announced so early
on friday we gotta play mahjong
yes but i end early to school starts on jan 2
ya i got just 2 weeks
i am gonna try to go hard from today onwards so that i dont have to study or do any work during the break
several assignments mostly and also to catch up on lectures
so we start school on august 20 i think so i dont have as much time as i thought
can you make that work with your schedule
if im going to asia i wanna go for at least 3 weeks i can meet you there if we cant travel together the whole time
well i wanna go with you to japan elsewhere i would be willing to try anything australia or thailand or vietnam etc
probably august 15 or so maybe even earlier than that
whats the earliest you can get off school
maybe in february tickets are gonna be expensive in the summer no matter what and japan itself is a very expensive travel destination so we are gonna have to ball out no matter what
ok that would be great if you can travel before august that would give us at least 2 weeks of travel which would be plenty especially if we are only traveling japan
ya i will be seeing you irl this holiday several times i hope
we need to play mahjong
yes its a lot of fun to play irl
you mean a mahjong parlor cuz i dont wanna lose money to the locals i mainly wanna see the sights and the culture and taste the food
oh hell no son 40 bucks can buy me one day of food
how do the sights cost money
i thought they are free
oh i see well i dont mind going inside a parlor just to look but its not worth losing money to play against real japs we can play in canada just fine
oh and btw i will be taking mad photos like fucking mad
i dont mind peters company if he is coming i will try to make it clear to him that i am a cheap motherfucker i am afraid he is gonna ball out too hard thats my main fear
lol we have some history together i just dont want our vastly different personalities and preferences to ruin the travel
ya for surr
yes we will hang with the man for sure yo tell me when you are coming back i am going to get bored real quick
like you will be free wednesday or you are arriving wedesday
yo lets set up a time for mahj and a time to meet pete to chat
i dont mind but they are not the most talkative people if you know some more exciting people i wouldnt mind meeting them too
lol then adelle and phillip will have to do
they are fine
actually i have a few friends in windsor who expressed interest in mahjong but they dont know riichi and they are not in toronto so no we could call up meng bao but he is a noob
absolutely no constraint
january 2 i would be thrilled to play literally all day son we can take a few breaks to eat
adelle is fine unless she is not avialable timewise
excellent thanks man i am looking forward to mahjong it up
we can go to sf basement again ya the libraries will probably have holiday hours
they are not ideal but i mean the place is free what more can you ask none of us go to u of t anymore so we dont have special acces
which building was that the time pinwen brought us to the pharmacy building
the mars building
well i dont know carlton nigger
thats cool but unfortunate maybe we can have meng
i can but i cant wait till then
i need dat pussay
thanks son i need your help to get that pussay
its cold but im glad to be back to eat home coming cooking and i am gonna play a ton of magic once my magic buds are free
i eat ok there but my food is simple
lol actually i did how did you know
o lol i am there just not in many i got a game called codenames as my gift and i gave an art book as my gift
we did a white elephant gift exchange it is a gift exchange with a bit of a mini game to it tina was not that fine at that party lol
yo i gotta tell you some shit about tina when we meet in person remind me
its a long story
its interesting not not urgent
what the fuck dude i dont think i can accept that
no man
i dont wanna meet strangers to play a fun game the fun of the game is that we can say whatever we want i am more reserved with strangers
why not just get men bao
dude black stefan is moved to california since a long time ago
as far as i know that time we saw him he only came to visit family
oh are you fucking serious
well call the nigger up my memory is gone to shit
lol dude you cant just call random people niggers especially black people
lololol how the fuck do you confuse them they are totally different
thats extremely fucking funny dude
yeah its just the wrong thing happening to the wrong guy like if it was a stefan with light skin it wouldnt have been so offensive
lol thats weird yes we should play with meng when the time comes i can also contact stefan bhagwandin
the hell  what happened to you
oh i thought you were talking about mengs reaction
lol but he knows you are the one with maj
thats what we were talking about but i wouldnt mind just hanging around him i just feel we got nothing in common
i guess so for some reason in my mind i dont have the best image of stefan i dont know why but when i think about him its not totally positive
yeah i think thats accurate i feel like his family is pretty wealthy and that lets him pursue things with less responsibility whereas i dont have that luxury so theres a disconnect between our values in life
yes well see

lmao i dont have that shit just regular porn son in fact i lost all my regular porn but its no big loss since i mostly stream these days
lol certainly not
you mean ottawa
god damn son you are still enjoying the good life eh
go meet her in real life son
ya man we are too busy for this shit whats the point honestly just to feel good at getting matches it is quite impractical
lol thats right son
alright well good luck and enjoy your last days in toronto son on to the next coop adventure
lol really man you cant take one fucking winter you gonna retreat to vancouver
you can get a humidifier or use some creams vancouver will have its own problems i think its crazy to move due to climate alone but if you find a waifu or a job there thats another story
no but i dont get eczema my sister has eczema and she uses lots of skincare products
ya sometimes i just ignore it
lmao i dont know what causes eczema
what the hell man i gotta study this shit up this shit is from last year
thats a good idea yo im out for now son good night
yo dude its a crazy busy tim we got 4 exams next week and i gotta go hard talk to you later
yo httpswwwredditcomrvideoscomments7r5mvlkidordersbongpackagearrivesandhismomwants this is the funniest shit i have seen in a long time
nah this was front page reddit last one tomorrow i am fucking burned out i hate studying for exams
andthe material is boring as hell
l o l ya in japan maybe
you gonna do coop in the summer then
alrght well keep me updated im gonna go now later son
yo apparently i passed
i went to talk to one of our admin staff about something completely different and she asked me how my test went and i said not so good and she was like yo lemme check for u
ya she is an interesting character she is normally quite professional so i thought it was weird she would do something not by the books
haha you could be right about that i am tired as hell i slept 4 hours 2 days ago and 5 hours last night
lol
it is extremely difficult for me to find the discipline or motivation to study in advance
ya absolutely it is boring as hell son i think if we had some responsibility to care for some patients it would be more interesting
but it would be harder to structure the curriculum that way cuz everyone would see different cases
lol aint nothing you can do about that shit we just gotta grind through it
that is very optimistic i know the curriculum is changing actually next year they are trying some new shit
i dont know if it will affect us but students like a few years in the future will have it different
but i dont nkow how different
im gonna go shower now might be on the computer in bed for a bit then sleep
i am fucking tired as hell son
lol i do that in my room so my roommates can hear me
unfortunately not one of my roommates got a big ass
cuz that makes her kind of hot but only kind of
well i dont have any roommates but she is my housemate
she lives in the room next door cuz i wanted to jerk it with her
lol how the fuck do i ask that question it is too fucking awkward
yo i am asking you you know chinese right
how do you say do u wanna fuck in chinese
son you better know how to say it in japanese at least when we go
lol
i dont think i do
loool ok cya man
no dude what the fuck is this format dude i have no way to open this shit send me that as a word document or copy paste it into a txt or rtf
alright son ill get this to you later tonight
yo whats your email ill email it to you
i just sent it to you good job son
lol youre welcome man glad i could help
im going to get dim sum with some buds here and i need to get tickets for my trip to egypt
fucking lmao holy shit dude youve never lost your unique sense of humor all my buds in windsor are med students yes
i also have friends in other years and in london but most people i hang out with are in my year in windsor
i am envious of the hot white girls in ottawa
i probably wouldnt either but at least the dream would be alive
the fantasy
lol well if you get the job at honda maybe you will go to a pinsaro for business meeting
ya its actually seriously possible
lol
you want to marry into wealth
yeah probably you would have no connections if you went to japan now right
lol what the hell sounds like they are fake thats how i would interpret it from a western culture lens
oh really to be honest i havent talked with her much since miami
we have all been really stressed from exams
interesting lmao dont read too much into it
oh i already went man we ate from 11 to 12 for brunch
oh btw i recently completed a game called mark of the ninja have you heard of it
its extremely well done you might like it i torrented it
its a stealth platformer game and the animations and controls makes you feel really in control and like a fucking ninja the mechanics fit very well for a stealth game it encourages patience and not getting caught
wait what the hell you dont have windows partition anymore
ah i see then how did you play gorogoa
woow i see
i think im gonna play through it today
i am realy excited
there have always been games but most used to played irl thats how they mde sports
lol magic was not a big gam and magic is still the best game of all time in my view
but video games are certainly a great platform for storytelling and emotional connections indie games werent as big back in the day the big name companies were in the golden age games like portal and half life 2
ya im sure ill be gushing about it
drowning in work son
lmao no man unfortunately not what about you
learning a ton of anatomy when are your interviews
lool
dont do any shit in the work place
son your interviews are soon how are you feeling are they skype
lol i see
its good to identify that you might want to know at least a little bit
nah you gotta relax son i can do a practice interview with you if you want
probably not in my opinion
thats a good attitude to have i bet they will test your japanese too
i see well in any case good luck to you son
if you go to japan to work in september will you still traveling there in summer
oh i see alright then thats great
lol tru
lol later
whats it about btw
i finished gorogoa it was amazing
truly innovative
yes it was a very suitable difficulty level
im going to toronto today son magic gp is tomorrow literally just hopped into a strangers car for rideshare
im going to make some big money trades and maybe play some side events
hell yeah son im gonna drop big money on that sweet card board
you dont even wanna know how much my cardboard is worth son
i got one card worth 500 i traded my way into it underground sea
thats right son blue and black just like grandmaster wang taught me
i play cube modern and now legacy thats what the underground sea is for i want to get more into legacy its truly a masters format a lot of critical decisions to be made at every turn
its fantastic man i wish you played i miss sharing such a big hobby with my boy
recently there is growing interest in pauper which is a format where you can only play common cards so the price point is low i think it looks very promising im going to keep my eye on it
if it becomes popular you gotta get back into the game son you can still play op cards in pauper
for example you can play brainstorm ponder preordain gush and delver of secrets you can also play lightning bolt and the artifact lands also ub teachings is one of the best decks in the format
its not as great as legacy in my opinion but id say its still fun and its cheap to get into and the games are complex and highly skill intensive
you know every time i talk to you about magic you always disappoint me so much i just wanna share a great hobby with my old buddy
but at the end of the day i dont think the competition angle is legitimate its a competitive game yes but theres tons of ways to play even though i know thats the reputation that you like to have
god damn that is indeed a very alienating attitude you have what i cant understand is how you can say that you might play modern if you stuck with the game but you wont get into it now
those are legitimate factors but the card pool thing isnt that problematic only a handful are popularly played
the money is legit i would buy you a deck if i had money
i would buy you a pauper deck if you play
god damn son i wish you didnt quit magic i am 100 serious that i think we could have become semi pros if we stuck together and practiced these past 10 years
yeah man i fucking love brewing decks
i consider it to be my specialty
i am just getting into legacy most of my competitive experience is in modern i have tinkered with a lot of variations on popular decks mostly involving gifts ungiven  based controlcombo
yes they are locked its very hard to brew a great deck almost impossible but its fun as hell for me and if you are familiar with the format and a good player you can do fine with a huge huge variety of decks in modern thats one of the formats most appealing features
no what is that
loooooooool that shit is taking us to heaven it sounds like a dangerous tech
lol true
lmao thats fucked man
your lack of skill will stop you
i am not there yet going to head over after lunch i hope it will not be too late to make some big trades
thanks man yo i am gonna test something dont respond to this
yes but im still in windsor ill not go home this time
you on toronto
nice im fine but stressed as hell its a busy time
lol i wish i were but no busy with work
how are you gonna spend your time this weekend lol well see son
yeah that would be nice
i did over march break now im catching up on shit
we will chat later man maybe skype me up tonight or something
lmao maybe it will only be controversy if i am in private we can chat him up too
talk about the trip
you fucked a girl
wow dude thats fantastic that was truly historic was that paulo vs luis scott vargas
oh i see yes hes a great player he was on stream a few months ago still playing control in a mirror it went to time it was fucking epic
likely staying in toronto for research or observership are you still open to going to japan or is that impossible
no it is not decided but i am still willing to go to japan im sorry about this shit man i know its difficult to plan
yes i will definitely try to keep that time open
i will keep that in mind that time window is likely best for me as well
ok whats up son
yes she played maj with us right
lol frank i understand what you are saying i think its reasonable to feel that way makes you wonder about what might have been right
ya i remember that conversation had now that you bring it up
son that isnt proof
no that is just evidence in support
come on us scientists cant be throwing around words like that for fun
we gotta speak accurately
once a scientist always a scientist i dont wanna hear any fucking pseudoscience shit from you master wang
ya ma n personally i think i will never forget the hell i went through it is a part of me now it really changed me
i dont think it was as bad as your situation
but it was not a pleasant time yes
oh really i thought we did
i have been talking about it a lot recently so i dont want to go over it in a lot of detail right now but i will just say that i was feeling depressed through most of it lmao
lmao i was doing repetitive mindless labour that didnt challenge me intellectually
and i felt that was the priority because i was in a rush to graduate on time so i didnt focus my efforts on the parts that i enjoyed such as analyzing and discussing papers y
i dont agree with that man
i am not gonna put the blame on anybody my prof was not great at nurturing me thats true he was too busy to really mentor me
i was under only very light management we met once a week to discuss progress but the rest was up to me
i  suppose i did but i wasnt in the right mental state at the time to be a great student it felt like survival day to day
so as i said i wont blame my pi
ya it might be true for me too but i dont know yo i dont wanna talk about that shit anymore
but next time we meet in person we can have a deep chat about that if you are interested i have been talking a lot about that experience recently so i am kind of burnt out
i came back to toronto this weekend so i figured it was time to meet a girl honestly i think it went fucking horribly i was pretty tired already because i was doing some work before meeting her
the most damning thing was that at the end of the date she seemed in a rush to leave she wanted to get the fuck out ya i met her on cmb
ya it was worth a try but i definitly made some mistakes
i am gonna offer to meet her again but i highly doubt she will want to based on her last impression we had a good chat
it was one of the better chats i had on cmb
ya
i guess i gotta keep practicing this shit so i am kind of tired today from that conversation deep conversations always tire me out
but on the other hand i think i would have felt like we didnt make a personal connection if we only talked about surface level shit
the thing is its a critical requirement for me to be able to talk intellectually with someone so i wanted to be sure that potential was there
and if it aint then i am likely not going to be interested in the person but today i think was too deep and too quick especially when i was already tired
ya as i said it was abstract stuff like how have you changed what kind of risks have you take in your life how well can you predict the desires of your future self
lol son i cant actually recount how we got to that topic but somehow we got there
yes exactly but also analyzing myself she seemed to be open to talking about that shit but it fucking drained me my mana got drained
its a shame cuz i think she was a nice girl i wish i did a better job today
lol you never asked
no when the fuck did you ask
oh shit imissed it im sorry
she has good dimensions she is quite tall almost my height and she aint too thin or too fat i didnt notice that she had big tits but she was wearing loose clothing
she is not extremely attractive but she is not extremely ugly she might be like a 610 perhaps a 65
lol was he white
i think thats a great goal but i will also say that i think a large part of his success on tinder is simply being white
god damn man i am disappointed i messed up the date today i could have met waifu but now i gotta keep trying
she was attractive enough perhaps on the lower threshold but sufficient i think i do want the hot girls but you cant always get what you want
nah man you can try but you might not succeed and you gotta be at peace with that shit
yes that might be true for many things but not everything for example i am damn fucking sure i could never become an olympic athelete
i am already too old to excel in the vast majority of olympic sports and my natural body is not well suited to the highest level of athleticism ok i might agree with you there
but sometimes a huge disadvantage is so fucking huge that it would be considered foolish to try to surpass it and in those cases i consider it impossible even though it might not be literally 100 impossible
but it would be foolish to attempt to make it a reality yo on another topic just from talking to you i realized that i show i have been watching might be one that you would enjoy
it is called money heist or la casa de papel
it is a spanish show about an ambitious robbery i think the way the plot is woven and some of the characters remind me a lot of some animes i have seen so i think you would enjoy it
ya let me know what you think if  you watch it
yo where was your display pic taken
oh shit
you are excellent man
you are looking professional in that sweater vest it suits you well
maybe a little if you stand real straight you will appear more confident but if you overdo it you could appear to be too arrogant
a lot of people gotta work on that
lol it is not a bad photo at all man
holy shit lol you cant joke about that man
what the fuck in my opinion it is better if you dont say that
what is the advantage of telling her that unless you want to ask her out
do you still have a crush on her now
she mentioned to me that she hasnt talked with you in a while
but i dont think anything bad happened btween you guys just no time
i think it will not accomplish much if you tell her you used to have a crush on her but it might make her feel less comfortable talking to you
ok
ya no problme man its been a long time since we had a good chat i have been extremely busy lately
lol well you initiated this chat son
are you coming to toronto at all or are you going directly from ottawa to japan
oh ok
i will probably see you next time i am in town then
ya you got the summer off right
no you said you had some shit to do oh fucking hell son are those in ottawa
oh hell no son
ok when does the summer course start
so which days will you in toronto between the end of this semester and the start of those courses
ok hopefully i will see you at end of april then
i will likely be back in 3 weeks from now so we will see son what did you win in your new pic
holy shit you started a business what the hell is cognitive search engine
dude you got a picture for that
i never got no fucking picture with the dean of u of t
what is that also i am curious what were the demographics like at the deans list
oh interesting google can already do a bit of tha
when i ask it a question like what is x it will have some commonly asked questions that are similar and show me the asnwers at the top of the page it will tell you at the top
damn that sounds fucking advanced
with who
it sounds like too big a project for a single person i thought you would have to join a lab
ok you sound really motivated
tomorrow i have a phone interview with a research man in toronto
so if i get that position i might be able to know my summer schedule soon
there is a technology called focused ultrasound that has several applications in neurologyneurosurgery for one it can increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier which might allow drugs to get into the brain tissue more easily
lol i doubt that brain cancer is honestly fucked
ya it is a pretty new idea
hmm actually i do think it is quite new
ya but people didnt think about this shit there is a guy at sunnybrook who made his own fucking helmet that delivers ultrasound to the brain like you cant buy that in the store so it is pretty new
if you use higher energy you can destroy the brain tissue which is actually useful in some diseases
but i think this project is focusing on the lower dose which can open the barrier but not kill anything
haha thanks frank i will see about this
it was fine he actually recommended me to another lab and i have an interview with them next week
so there will be perhaps another week
to be honest well he said i was welcome to go but he thinks the other lab will fit me a lot better because i am interesting neuro and his lab is more on the psychiatry side
the lab he recommended me to is actually the same as the lab i worked in during undergrad so i hope the pi will take mercy on my ass
ya the guy i talked to today is a neurosurgeon but i told him i wanted to be a neurologist
the pi
it is andres lozano i think he had a decent impression of me but he is very close with my masters pi who does not have a good impression of me
yes definitely it is a fucking shame
he is a fucking pro dude probably the most pro scientist i ever met in my life
ya  i am just gonna pray and if he dont want my lazy ass then i might be fucked for this summer
i am going to talk to the original prof i talked to today and ask if i can work on his side and if i cannot then i might work with a prof i talked to back in february
but it would make me feel safe if i could work with my old pi because he is a big name and he got some good connections to neurologists in toronto and i want to match to toronto neurology
he is md phd and he was one of the first to work on deep brain stimulation in canada and now he is working on the focused ultrasound and ya he works 247 all the neurosurgeons work that hard
yes he is married with 2 kids his kids are pro as well
one of them is a stuent of md phd at u of t and the other is an md student in ireland
his kids are nice i like them i dont know they both went to ucc they probably had a great education
he makes time he is extremely smart i am always intimidated when i talk to him to be honest
i feel like an ape
lol we will see
yo frank i got your email about the japan trave thing
but i dont think i understand what its about
first of al who is this person and why is she at ubc how is that related to your c urrent program
what is hri
ok it seems you would be allowed to travel as long as you are back in time to process your studentwork visa
ok i see so why dont we come back a little earlier
how early would you want to come back to feel safe
sounds like that might be possible and you have to come back because you need to leave your passport at the office
but you also need your passport to travel for tourism
ok is it impossible to get an evisa i got one for egypt i never left my passport anywhere
ok i see so if we come back on august 6 thats cool with you
even though you only need a week technically to get the visa you want to leave some extra time is that right
you need to get it on the 17th at the latest
ya i read it
remind me when you are leavig for japan again
dude that is plenty of time for a one week turnaround time for the visa dont you think
the 1320 break affects businesses in japan but the government isnt a business there is no way the visa office will be closed i think you are being overly conservative with the dates
but if you are leaving sept 2 i think you have more time than that
ok
yes exactly i think yuko wrote that to alert you that it might be hard to be a tourist in japan around the time when businesses close cuz you got nothing to eat
lmao i am serious man
when will you know your start date i think you should give yourself like 2 weeks in canada to get your visa
so we can come back around 2 weeks before your start date
wait you wont know your start date until you get the visa yes i think 3 weeks would be an ideal length of time and we could consider even  going to other asian countries such as south korea
oh really
well we can discuss the length later for now the first order of business is for me to learn my schedule and for you to learn  your start date
you know the flights are very expensive to japan and the flights are very long time too i think it would be best if we could maximize our value
the flights will be shorter distance so they will also be cheaper to be honest i am not sure how to set my budget for the trip i dont want to ball out
i am okay to stay at shittier places we just need a place to sleep at night with internet
oh really
oh shit toronto meds
god damn alright man i will talk to you again on thursday when i sort the shit out
yes
and if i cant get research i might just do some summer electives instead
that would give me more time to travel would you consider 3 weeks
it would only cost us the extra days of hostel right if that place is 2030 that would be an extra 200 approximately
i would suggest maybe half the time in japan half in south korea if the flights to sk are cheap enough ya sure take your time to process it
ya of course
what is your concern about more than that
about the visa you mean
ok sure 25 weeks can work for me too you know if i love japan maybe i will even come to visit you during your yearthere
i will have a week off over christmas ya if this summer trip doesnt work out perhaps i will indeed visit you over christmas
ya i thought not
yooooo
congratulations man
thats fucking pro what did you win it for
what the fuck that is insane dude
yes and that is also a lot of money for a general scholarship engineering dept is balling
lol ya maybe man
it is probably just a default amount for your gpa god damn this man is rolling in money
ya i got some osap money but i gota return most of it
a small portion is a grant but most is a loan
i dont remember
our province really believes in your potential it might depend on which program we are enrolled in
honestly i dont pay too much attention to it i am just grateful for the money and i remember i wll have to return a lot of it when i graduate i am deep in the hole man
lol exatly ok i am out for now talk to you later son
httpsaeoncoessaysprogrammedtoloveisahumanrobotrelationshipwrong interesting article
yeah this is something good to discuss in person by the way
meng bao expressed interest in traveling this summer maybe to central europe
oh shit son guess i missed you in toronto
no i was not son but i might be next weekend or next next weekend will you be in ottawa for summer school from now on
the hell so quick i thought you left around 3
you were the driver
yo lol not specifically japanese ones
but i thought the article was very interesting
it is an uncomfortable one i had the same thought but the article brings up some interesting points like what we are expecinting out of the partner and the potential for betrayal
in a real partner it is possible for them to betray you or cancel the relationship so every moment you are in it it is because both members actively want to be in it
no but it is not changeable there is no risk these are my words not the writers
it means something different like it is different to be wanted by a human who could potentially change her mind at any point and not want you anymore
lmao l m a ooooo that is not a bad way to put it man
maybe
yo you heard about the yonge and finch attack right
apparently that dude was an incel and he was mad at the world for his failure to get sexual goods and the article talks about the unfair distribution of sexual goods
well if you have some trait or traits that make women not desire you
yes and some people may have the misfortune of being unable to find a suitable relationship
thats partially true but there are some things that will probably be universally found to be unattractive and makeup and shit can only go so far like if someone gets a horrible burn on their face
lmao
not all burn victims are the same man how about somebody who is extremely obese there are some traits that will be disliked by the vast majority of people
and you will certainly have less access to sexual goods you gonna blame the obese person frank what if they have a metabolic disorder
i dont know of one but im just saying that being obese isnt entirely the individuals fault
yes its absolutely unfair many things in life are unfair but the sex robots may be a way to repair some of this unfairness
well we can look at the real world for that sex toys are a successful product vr porn is successful prostitutes are successful it shows there is demand for sex substitutes
lol ya maybe they can be useful but the article also mentions some pitfalls like it would be bad if they furthered a misogynistic view
well its not about having it normalized but about the content that it portrays and sex is hardly underground i mean porn is hardly underground
some of it does but according to the article some of it is also subversive and promotes female power
what do you not see some porn like rape fantasies or maid or blackmail porn is misogynistic cuz it portrays the females in a position of lower power but other types of porn can be empowering or not misogynistic
no but we need to watch out for keeping them not misogynistic thats what the article is saying many current types of sex bots could be considered misogynistic
well a lot of the fantasies that i tthink are popular in japan might fit that bill like harem fantasy or having a servant or maid girl
ya i cant say im an expert
right well its not illegal its just a question of ethics
im not sure the ethics is still unclear
lol
yes but i am tired as hell im surprsed to see you up at this hour
o hooooo
god damn did you fly there
god damn yo
lemme clarify some shit
a few years ago you strongly claimed that the only place in the world you wanted to travel to was japan yet now you seem to be okay to travel to a nonjapan place this summer
im glad to hear that man cuz i thought you were fucked in the head when you stubbornly claimed to only want to travel to japan but you wouldnt admit it at the time
dude i tried but you wouldnt hear any of it you were defending yourself like a motherfucker
ya thats it
ya i understand ma thats reasonable
now i am afraid peter and i cant sttle on a travel plan cuz i think that motherfucker wants to travel in luxury
and that is just incompatible with what i can afford
lay what
i aint got nothing to say what kind of ultimatum can i offer peter and i are just going back and forth he wants comfort i want not too expensive so he thinks the best compromise is a cruise
no its our whatsapp
ill leave you to it son honestly i am okay if i dont travel with peter thats the raw fucking truth i respect the guy and he can be fun to be with but our personalities are quite different
are you gonna be in toronto soon i am there this wekend and next weekend
man we gotta hang out this summer your fucking summer school is bullshit son
lmao this life is fucked we gotta give up so much of our living hours to serve society some lucky people can bypass that by winning the lottery or being successful in business
it is a privilege to serve in some ways but its also a requirement realistically i am just talking in general
ya i am i want to have all my hours available to do what i wat i dont want to have to work some of my life and watch those hours waste away
so given the reality i am pleased to be in the career path i chose
my life when i am working i cant use those hours to enjoy myself freely
ill see about it anyway i gotta sleep man i am tired as hell
thats a good question i think its possible fuck i just killed a huge spider
i am fucking scared to sleep now i was on my computer in bed with all the lights off and suddenly that spider just popped up on my monitor
i think it dangled downward from my  ceiling the spider came out of nowhere man
i had to go hunt it down i am gladi caught it otherwise i wouldnt have slept
ya ok good night son
yes thats a great summary of my attitude and ya it was a good talk son i wish we could hang out in person and chat more
it is a relatively chill time and i want to play magic this weekend and next weekend is the magic gp
ya
what the fuck  thats the only reason i go back man to see friends and family
i carpool with my friend i pay him 40 for a round trip sometimes i can also take the bus for around 70 round trip or do a ride share in toronto
1820
nice ill be there too it is the magic grand prix
near cne
dude are you joking me canadian national exhibition
it is near the lakeshore in the west end of the city near king and ossington
im gonna go make some trades and play in side eents events
its up to you son i never regret coming back to tonrot
god damn dude u gotta make more friends you can see your parents
anyway ill leave it up to you but if you do come back that weekend i will make time to see you son
in fact how about maj
ok i think meng is considering coming with us so we would only need 1 more for maj shame peter dont play it is completely illogical that he dont play
i cant fucking deal with that shit
ya ia gree
lol they would shit on us
i think they are gonna say something like we need to be more flexible or that we should give up on travelling together

do you have any black friends
thats very interesting man and makes sense there are lots of french speaking african countries and ottawa speaks french too you should meet those guys man
lmao i understand what youre saying
no i was curious because reddit talked about how black people love anime and i had no idea why cuz it is a japanese product that is real far from africa and america
yo that is exactly what the article said did you read that or did you think of that yourself
god damn a fucking scholar of anime eh
i think its interesting to explore how anime and black culture are linke cuz they seem totally different i never really had black friends ever so its hard for tureme to understand black cul
hard to understand black culture stefan b is indeed black
but he was culturally totally white ya he aint like those people hanging out on the streets wearing baggy pants like they are very excitable and try to demonstrate that excitement publicly
definitely but there is truth to it
lmao
lol thats a good observation but why why do black people tend to react more dramatically than other people
i know you share some of that mentality cuz you are also dramatic sometimes
and it is funny as hell when you are
i cant say that it does but i find those outbursts to be funny its hard for me personally to overcome that inhibition to behave like that
yes its not good to be noticed
its similar in older western culture with parents and kids kids should be seen not heard
and in china you have to be humble and show respect to your elders it means kids shouldnt talk when adults are there
that is true but in eastern philosophy discipline is a big virtue to have control over your expressions and shi t i just think being dramatic like those black youth is really opposite in many ways to chinese teachings
lmao
to be honest i definitely felt it especially once i started school in deer park in elementary school there were plenty of asians but even still there was some racist shit being said
not necessarily but in deer park man i definitely felt i didnt belong there
most of my class were white people who grew up in the wealthy areas nearby meanwhile i had to commute from downtown
i didnt have any friends there yes i think it is
lmao which white boys
god damn those are ancient names
did you not feel your communication skills were linked to your ethnicity as an immigrant your english skills were not as good as the native speakers
are you serious
that surprises me
but i would point you towards the differences in asian males vs asian females in terms of desirability in western culture
anthony cho dont remember hearing that name
possibly i know that was a rich school
my neighbour in mccaul street his family moved houses just so he could go to brown he was a littlek id
i dont think its a private school but its known to be good and its in a wealthy area
anyway interesting to get your perspective on this i definitely had poor communication skills in those days
so i guess thats partly to blame
i wasnt disliked but i felt i didnt have many friends
no i dont think i was included in social gatherings but back in those days there werent many i felt like i had nothing to say to a lot of my classmates
to be honest i dont remember those days clearly its been a while since i really thought about deer park that is a trip
they call me out
i see man we will never see those days again that seems insane to me
oh shit who was that man i must know
i remember that name but i dont know if i remember what she looked like i remember alex bh tho she was fucking fine man
i think she went to u of t engineering
i could be wrong
what happened to those girls man
ya man alex bh is at u of t according to fb
and she was a former chess instructor says she is a research assistant
dude she is fucking jacked
httpswwwfacebookcomalexborossharmer it is simple she is honestly one of the most jacked girls i ever seen
well that is what facebook always makes people think dont buy into that
its possible but its also possible she got some problems that you cant see by looking at her profile
lmao well as i recall her dad was into chess maybe she took a greater interest in it and improved
and i suspect chess is like compsci wehre there is a lower threshold of entry for girls because it is such a male dominated field
for her to be an instructor its possibly easier because shes a girl than if she were a male
i dont nkow either yo who was alison grenier i cant find any shit on fb
ok
she seems pretty hot
ba from queens then a george brown degree in management how did you decide that
so you are giving up your dream of living in japan
haha i would also like to have a life in toronto man that is one of my dreams i suspect it will take me longer to get there than it would takeyou
man that would probably be a bit too weird but you can try it
ya later man
i think you told me about it i havent watched it yet right now im watching west world and the expanse theyre both da bomb
yeah man they are the best sci fi on tv right now fuck you son sci fi is the greatest genre of all time
lol those were fucking great times mac man i still have a dream that one day we will play magic together again
lol dude remember when a long time ago you said you only had interest in going to japan and nowhere else and i said you were stubborn as fuck and only recently you agreed with me
thats a legitimate argument there is a spectrum of competitiveness for example would you say that i play magic competitively
im absolutely not a literal pro nor a semipro but i am not bad and i take each game seriously and i try my best to win every game wasnt that exactly your situation with dota2
i am saying that i dont believe you have a consistent definition of playing competitively and there i believe such a definition doesnt exist as such it is illogical to use that nebulous term to exclude yourself from certain recreational activities
gg son in the end i just want to see you have fun without trying to beat up other people and one of my fondest wishes even to this day is that we can have fun playing magic again
ya stefan black is a fucking noob
he has certainly practiced a lot more than me lately and he is more familiar with the meta i think hes better than me
but i gotta say i think im not bad
i am not not into beating up others but i love the game itself more than the opportunity to defeat others stefan mains modern and he is interested in legacy as well
lmao did your father tell you that that sounds like some pop psychology shit
all i can say is if you do choose magic as your next game i would be thrilled
but i thought you craved the competition ohand btw i downloaded the witness recently i played 78 puzzles so far it also says 3 do you know what that meas on my save file
oh ok
i am impressed with the honesty of your reflection i keep reading that thats a problem with the modern generation in the age of internet and advanced communication deviecs but you are capable of it
but thats exactly the opposite of instant gratification
ya i see what youre saying now that youve identified a problem with yourself what do you plan on doing
well you wont quench  your thirst for domination by playing single player games 1p games are for the experience it is almost like you are playing with the game designer
the designer is trying to challenge you or show you his creativity or try to lead your thinking in a particular direction
i learned that phrase a long long time ago
do you know it from somewhere in particular
which
lmao ok
i would honestly be so fucking thrilled if  you made that decision my friend there is a saying within magic players you never quit magic you just take breaks
yeah but its not good for playing strangers too much bm and noobs i play against stefan and our friend from u of t zach sometimes with stefans friend andrew
lol dude that is a very frank style humour so that was the movie with the black drill instructor
there is a very broad selection of competitive decks in modern currently the best deck is called humans which might cost around that much stefan and i were actually speculating about what deck you might choose upon your return
its a bit more complicated than that for example storm costs around that much but almost 100 of that value is in a single sideboard card which wont make a huge impact in most cases
for a full playset yes control decks are going to be expensive in modern the cheapest decks are combo
which happens to be my favourite archetype ya dude sadly almost literally 100 of the cards from around the time you played have gone up interestingly figure of destiny is cheap as hell now
ya you got about a year to scope out the situation and think about if you wanna return to the game
but we are always here for you son
thats true i am jealous of the magic scene there to be honest a lot of creative decks and innovations come out of japan my favourite player is shota yasooka
he is a master
i believe he is still active but i havent seen him play for a while
a lot of the old pros are still very active
its around 500 but you can save around 200 by not getting the card leyline of sanctity
oh lol if you are considering this seriously i highly recommend to playtest the deck or watch some videos of it in action to see if it suits your style
yeah personally i used to admire control after getting beat up by you but in the last few years ive come to appreciate combo too
lol who did the deck tech it has some very sweet plays
oh ok he is a real entertainer
i can play you tonight around 11pm
oh shit what time are you sleeping
ok you know what son since you got such a thirst how about 730
you fucking thirsty boy
you got cockatrice updated and shit
it is
uhh httpscockatricegithubio i am going to wash the dishes now be ready soon
yo come on discord
ya you can how do i add you
httpsdiscordgguzyarq go itno the badlands channel i am calkabouter if all you wanan do is win storm is a cheap combo deck that is usually able to do well
that takes a ton of grinding
in my opinion youre better off playing a deck you truly enjoy and when you grind you can buy cards with your credit and resell them if you want to reclaim your investment
but i strongly advise to not think of magic as a game where you can try to reclaim your money its very grindy to do that but theoretically possible i can expand on this more later
ya ya
this word has an interesting way of being broken down stanley sent a photo
no i didnt cuz you used the slang thot
that shit is long gone son
and i never took 247 i took 249 upon someones advice and that course fucked me so hard
lol ya thats me dud c ant hep it cant help i t
we finished our skills exam on thursday and next week we have 4 final exms
then i start research the monday after that ya thats it i am still down for it but i have been too busy lately to look into it
i thought meng bao said he would do some research
i would have loved to go to japan son
in my opinion theres not much research to do just to decide on countries flights trains and hostel in terms of attractions and shit we can handle that much closer to the travel
uhhhh when is that happening i might be working at that time
i will be starting residency by then if all goes well
and if all dont go well then i will have to work my ass off rather than take time offf so its impossible but i would be down to go in the time leading up to the olympics
we should have june off in 2020 yes indeed it is the last summer of my life
you lucky motherfucker you know if we had gone into the work force we would already have been done with summers especially early on in our careers where you gotta prove your loyalty and shit
thats true but you gotta use it for christmas and family shit you know
yo you wanna play cockatrice
what i know is that youre trying to troll me so fuck you son
not currently i was watching a bit on twitch
you gonna have a change of heart or just trolling
lmao ya i understand son sure lets play you need a list of a cryptic deck
ok
stanley sent an attachment go on discor yo son happy birthday what do you wish for this year i will see if i can grant it
lol im sorry i cant help you there
well would you consider prostitutes to be sweethearts
then i doubt we would have been able to do it if we had gone to japan
lol
lol dude are you serious right now
like first you say something indicating your sexual appetite then you start talking about romantic ideals the two are not really compatible you gotta pick one attitude to go with
yeah i think most men fantasize about having sex with multiple attractive women but thats different from wanting the romantic ideal of intimacy and trust with one person you cant really have both
lol im trying man but its pretty hard
lol i highly doubt thats gonna happen with any of them its a shame man
lol dude the boyfriends have either moved here or were always here its not like its a distance relationship or anything except in 1 case anyway that shit is off the table
lmao dude i dont think you really appreciate how serious some people are about their relations
ya i guess so
i have 2 exams left then i am excited to go home and play magic maybe hit up the dating scene in toronto during my short time there
lmao what the hell man honestly i am kind of tired of the process feel like i got nothing out of it
yeah a real numbers game
i dont really care to improve on that to be honest i dont see it as a game cuz its not fun it feels like a fucking grind
like in rpgs where u gotta grind some fucking gathering quest except you gotta grind through x dates before you find a suitable match
ya i dont really have any more thoughts on the matter just that sometimes im in the mood for it and sometimes im not and right now i am not
no man i am tired of that shit
we can talk about this shit in person man for now i am not in the mood to think about girls
u just gotta watch porn
lol as long as youre functional man
yes man are you
when iis the long weekend lol ya we will take care of business
ok nice
oh shit man that weekend is a big magic tournamne t but i will make time to see you
lol why not man
let him respond to your ultimatum i agree with it too even though it is a savage move
it is a savage move man it is like we are abandoning a friend even though peter is a person who can be difficult to work with but i agree that it was a necessary move
except the truth is i am still gonna go if peter doesnt go i am fine to travel with just you and meng
the real truth is it would be easier to travel without peter cuz i think his habits and expectations are just too different from mine
i agree but for the sake of argument you could also say that if we were true friends with peter we would ball out on a hotel to accommodate his rich ass needs
cruise is actually the same cost as a regular vacation cuz you gotta pay for all the excursions and activities at the places the boat stops otherwise you are just paying for a resort but confined to a ship
i just fucking did it nigger
we will see what he says
god damn you gotta crack down on him i am not balling out too hard
chill dude we will find something it is possible to book even a month in advance trust me ive traveled a lot recently
no son we will do it together when peter is convinced i am busy this summer cant handle it all alone
peters proposal was fucked i did peru one week for like 2k ish less than 2k actually and a few years ago meng and i did 2 weeks in france for like 2k as well
this was my first week the lab is busy as hell and i was taking care of some documentation shit this week for going bak to school
no i am downtown at twh
lol how the hell do you know lozano
i am technically working with lozano but i havent seen him yet he is really busy i am mainly working with his phd students
ya i am crunching numbers
from some data of patients who had essential tremor and were treated with a new technology calld focused ultrasound well i am crunching those numbers so that i can write a paper
yes
ya i guess so
umm so far i hung out with jamie and meng bao and some magic friends and i hung out with dk and bernard ma
they are very successful
dk left for edmonton where he is doing 3 years of internal medicine residency
and bernard is going to start anaesthesia residency in toronto
ya anaesthesiologists work with surgeons so they are in the or but they dont do the surgery
beernard is a fucking pro man
like it is competitive as fuck to match to toronto for residenc and anaesthesia is also a competitive program
he is definitely confdient anyway how are things iwth you son btw i am not going to greece with peters plan
i am not going to meet him it is a waste of time and i am not a good convincer
i think what should happen is we look at a flight and hotels without booking then come up with an ultimatum to deliver to everyone either they buy in or they dont come
we can do it this weekend or something
to be honest i havent been in the mood to think about vacation cuz i am busy as hell
lol my mood is unpredictable but we can sit down and do it this weekend
yo i wonder if we can go to turkey it might be dangerous
it is ver historic its an interesting place where european and middle eastern cultures meet
i am just throwing ideas out there man
to be honest i am not sure where i wanna travel
if we had a solid plan as to where to travel it would be easier we already made a plan as to the time which is early august and for 2 weeks now we need to nkow where
lol why dont u know anything
god damn you fucking useless piece of shit
you gotta be a dreamer and look up travel blogs and shit
not all the time but a lot of my facebook friends post their travel pics and it makes me jealous as hell
well it is a natural reaction
lmao dude that would be fucking jokes but how are you gonna get these incredibly good pictures you need to find some beautiful women and show off your worldly possessions
lol ya you oculd do that
lmao yo dont feel that way you have been racking up degrees that aint nothing
and regarding travel what i can say is this i am pretty sure that if just go somewhere and be flexible about accommodating each others interests we will have a good time and it doesnt matter too much where we go
that is cool with me but remember it is a hot time and peter might not be cool with a lot of hiking
lol
i dont mind going with him but i think he is an inflexible man
ok as i said my random recommendation is central europe it is safe there and there is a lot to do but i am not extremely excited by it
meng bao is a worldly man maybe he knows some shit
shit son i agree with that but i always hated reading ppaers
thanks son
god damn you are probably right if i can get a paper from my work this summer i will be satisfied i talked to my old pi yesterday
my pi is a great guy
no no it was my masters pi who told me that he is suneil kalia
he was lozanos phd student back in the day lozano aint got time to talk to a lowly student like me
lol i will never be smarter than lozano good luck son
yes it was all about visiting museums historic locations and taking in the architecture and beauty of the city and also trying local foods partying is something that can be done but i am not that interested in it
are you saying you are not interested in going to cities
trust me man they are not the same
what the fuck are you serious
well paris has many famous destinations that are obviously not in prague like the eiffel tower and the louvre and the cuisines are different too
lol well thats fine i didnt really know mcuh about them but you learn it wen you go
ok i see would you be interested in seeing some wwii history we could go to a concentration camp in germany
meng bao would know all about that
damn dude we gotta be respectful if we go in fact meng bao will make sure of it we went to vimy ridge with him in france and he was very respectful
lmao meng can be serious when it comes to war history
dude definitely do not do that shit in germany it is literally illegal to do some things referring to hitler and nazis positively
it would be like  going to the middle of detroit and yelling nigger you are gonna get your ass beat
my dude whats happeningw ith you i just looked up some flights looks like around 1100 for a round trip i think thats doable for me perosnally what do you think this is to germany
you got nothing else to say son
to be honest recently i saw some pics from a friend who went to peru and it made me thirsty for a more adventurous trip
oh yes i dont wanna go there specifically
but somewhere more adventurous than europe could be fun
lol i mean it dont have to be crazy but i just think europe is a bit too similar to our everyday lives
ya i agree
but tell me about them natural locations cuz right now i dont know none
ok
oh norway could be interesting we could see the northern lights i always wanted to see that
i need some help from you man i cant do all this myself i could if it was a simple city travel ive done it many times before
ya
if you can come up with a bunch of places that are great and also close to each other we can start making a plan it doesnt have to be in europe if its cheap
it was dinner and there was tax and tip i think it was like 32 before tax and tip
it was a weekendholiday so it was more
you can backcalculate how much it cost i beleive it was 32 before tax and tip
next weekend is the magic canadian nationals but i will make time to see you if you come down i guarantee it
i dont wann go to that bbq place again if we are eating out i wanna try something new also it was too expensive
lol those motherfuckers
you kep the receipt
oh ok
dude service charge is the same thing as tip
dude no where are you getting this info
stanley sent a photo this is their menu
dinner holiday is 34 for adult
lol shit son
lmao its possible but i dont think it was their magic meat if it had any effect it was probably just you eating more meat than before
lo man dont engage in magical thinking if you prioritized biking you would just eat a shit ton of shit tasting meat and you have no evidence it is just afeeling
lol yay ou could do that
it was but i found it too expensive for what we got and i overate thanks to peters guidance
no i dont know it maybe ill watch it later theres also a sequel to life is strange
yeah i think so culture and food i want some sick photos but i dont really want to walk around in museums all day
oh really why europe
god damn i wanna go for 2 weeks son
yo man
sorry i was out all day anyway you did some probing into the travel stuff
tell me about t it
ive already been to paris i dont wanna go there again
copenhagen
wat is there to do there
what the hell is interlaken there are currently a few others who are on the fence about this trip
i got 2 friends who dont know each other but would be interested in travelling
actually you know alex aroella from vic
and the other is not a nigger he is a chinaman
it matters for planning
god damn would you be fine with travelling just the 2 of us
ok
if it is the 2 of us you have to not be too fucking reckless
i dont know if i can handle you  just by myself
dont say nigger in germany
lol ok lemme look at your plan and i will tell you what i htink of those cities
do we need any equipment to go there like hiking shits
i appreciate you keeping us on track you said you are purely interested in europe
and are you cutting peter out of this
god damn a cruel ultimatum
to be honest i agree with you lemme look up the prices of air fare
that is gonna limit my locations
ya but why
dude do not suggest an overnight train please fuck no son
especially if the train is short because it will fuck up our sleep
i can do it if the train is long like 78 hours
but not if its 45
httpswwwtripsavvycomtopsouthamericatourismdestinations1637262 i am assessing south america right now asia is too expensive for me i think the flights are around 600 more than going to europe
south am is 1700 yes
sorry that is what i meant
asia is 1700 so asia is out south am is similar price to uerope
well for some of these things it will be expensive as hell because the locations are remote europe defnitely has the highest density of touristy shits in the world that is unbeatable most of europes touristy things are cities
estimate on price
lemme see it is 50 usd per day on average for living expenses
ya but not including the cost of the trip
like transportation it is actually a famously expensive place lol
patagonia i have been only to peru machu picchu lima and cuzco patagonia is like chile and argentinas southern wilderness
lol you almost certainly will have to buy bottled water which will be expensive because it is remote and the living conditions are likely gonna be pure shit brb gotta charge
shit son i finished did you think more about patagonia cuz i think it is too expensive and adventurous
httpswwwbemytravelmusecompatagoniatripcost ya i agree these people spent 3k for 60 days
i think that is not including flight
what do u mean what happened
we didnt have to hunt or anything but the conditions were shit there was often no warm showers and it rained the entire time so all our clothes were wet and no drying machines to dry them overnight
we had to walk in plastic bags because our shoes were soaked we had rain coats but it was not enough to protect  you especially during our mountain biking because we had to bike through small streams
that soaked you up from below it was fucked
because it was cold as fuck
in the mountains yes
maybe 5
son you werent there you dont understand the conditions you can say that we could have done stuff but it is not as simple as that the conditions were shit and we had mad diarrhea the entire time
i even vomited one night
no the seasons are reversed in sout america
we ate extremely shitty food served at the small towns that we stopped by
rice with boiled veggies and a tiny bit of meat and fried chicken is also very popular there but expensive they have some unique things like purple corn juice
dont know they must have contained some bacteria
i have no idea i am thinking about other travel destinations too httpswwwlonelyplanetcombestintravelregions1
shit man thats a lot of pressure on me
yeah alaska is very expensive too all these remote areas are expensive cuz they gotta ship food and stuff and the infrastrcuture is not as good as high traffic cities
ok hmm have you considered africa
lmao thre is a large desert there ok whatever man there is natural beauty in africa too
oh shit son
to be honest frank i am an indecisive person so i dont know what to do
there are a lot of conflicting thoughts i want to see beautiful shits but i dont want to make myself endure discomfort
i am fairly flexible
norway is expensive man
and it is dark as hell
they dont get much sunlight there but it is certainly somewhere we can consider going like europe is overwhelming in terms of choice
italy and denmark are like on opposite sides of europe yo tell me the exact dates you are gonna travel that will give us more accurate flight prices
you got any flexibility on that so my frst day of class is aug 20
i wanna be back from the trip in toronto on like around august 16
cuz i need to recover and shit before school starst
it is a little early but i can swing it if you gotta do it i think if we return on the 16th it is ideal or the 15th
oh shit why is that
when are you leaving for japan
i see so the 13th is a hard deadline for you
ok
ok so then i agree that august 114 is the best bet for the time window i cant depart too early because my lab shit gotta get done
august 1 is literally the earliest i could possibly depart like august 1 morning would be ok
ok so africa is too expensive eh
where in africa did you look at
ok umm well europe is around 1100 and so is south am but asia is like 1700 at least
yeah i think asia is off the table
you said oyu wanna go to italy
we will have no problem finding shit to do trust me man
what do u wanna do in switzerland
shit i dont know about the visit the mountains thing it sounds intense
i dont want to camp in the mountains
what do u think of turkey
httpstravelgccadestinationsturkey it is mostly the eastern border but i think istanbul is safe yo nevermind turkey for some reason it is expensive as fuck i dont understand why
i am looking into prague it is the same price as western europe yo
my other idea right now is to go to the usa or canada and go to national parks we got some great natural shit in this continent
ok lemme look into some places
oh right well honestly i think aug 114 is close to my ideal dates
but these trips we might need to rent a car are you cool with that
im still reading im going deep in the tank
the us parks are expensive i am back to considering europe now i am interested in prague and budapest those will take about 67 days in total so wed have another week to visit maybe 2 other places
its my dads birthday today so we just had some family over to celebrate otherwise not much
i have been playing magic and seing buds
lol thanks i am not that busy now the family just left
it is an idea they are close to each other
it is around 1100 to go to one place then we will train the rest of the way
i am not sold on it but if you explain why you wanna go i might reconsider
what the fuck no i did not know that god damn
no man i want to know about that
anyway those cities have beautiful architecture ravnica was inspired by that style of buildings
oh hell no son dont you be forgetting ravnica it was the city of guilds
it is not a big deal to me to go to those places or no t
they are just places i thought about i want to choose the perfect location but i dont know what that is
i remember in my previous vacations i was very excited and i knew exactly where i wanted to go
ya that is one exapmle well my first trip ever was to paris and i was so excited and it was a great trip
i am not even that interested in south africa it is a racist place it is fucked
if we are doing city tourism there is no need for preparation i have been on several city tourism trips and thats been the case
city tourism
to be honest at this instance i am not that excited by the idea of city tourism but my current mood is an unusual one for me cuz in the past i enjoyed city tourism a lot
lol may i ask you how do you know the price got more expensive cuz when i bought my ticket to egypt in advance it was around 1100 and egypt and prague are about the same distance from here
it is something i heard about as well but i dont know how true it is i totally agree we should book soon lemme rephrase it this way the issue right now for me is identifying a worthy location
well my friend who i went with robin came up with the idea and i always heard legends about machu picchu it is a wonder of the world or some shit and the hike to the place seemed adventurous
no just one week it was during our march break
i wish we had more time there we missed some attractions because of the short time we spent 2 days in cusco which is the base camp basically for our 4 day machu picchu hike
no we lived in small htels no camping but machu picchu is high altitude so you must spend 1 day in cusco a city thats closeset to mp to get used to the height
i wouldn not want to od a trip as difficult as mp anyway that trip nearly killed me it was not relaxing at all
i was interested in the art and history there some of the most famous art ever was there and 2 of my favourite composers were buried there so i went to visit them
i was also excited by the reputation and the chance to travel with friends without my parents but ive done that before now so that independence is not that exciting anymore
anyway man i want to go somewhere and take beautiful pictures i dont care too much where it is as long as it is not too expensive and i have not been there before
how the hell is it the only alpine country in europe do you want to visit the physics men cern is in switzerland
i am fine with booking this week we will mention it to the man
ill tell him not
now
lmao its done eh
you dropped a fool
what do you think of peters greece idea i dont want to go on a guided tour and it seems a bit short but it could be interesting to go to greece
im saying we could adapt the trip its definitely too far from switzerland we could perhaps do greece turkey and another im playing fnm now talk to you tonight
ya i meant tnm i went 201
ya man i am just indecisive it is a big sum of money we are spending on this trip and i want to make the most optimal decision can you understand my situation here
lmao dude yeah i hear what youre saying ive never felt like this about travel in the past so im not sure whats happening to me usually im very excited and i know exactly what to do
yeah i know man i am gonna need to decide in like 3 days
there is no removal to stall this clock
i am the one who clocks
yeah i hear you son
you said youre going home this weekend
lets meet and make the bookings
when are you gonna be here
ok lets hang out on saturday and take care of this business
my current thinking is this i will accept going on a city tour in europe including budapest and prague as we were discussing before but another idea on my mind is american national parks
i am fine with america but i prefer to avoid canada
because in 4th year we will be goig around the country and i think i will have some chances to check things out at that time
um let me check the schedule nah i am cool i might not even go on saturday so we can hang out any time on saturday
what do you wanna do that day
like we should hang out in addition to taking care of trip
sure you can come to my house
but how are we gonna hang out that day
would you like to play mahj
oh are you serious so this is a purely business trip
well that is fucked up you got any time to see peter or meng bao
ya i definitely want to hang out for fun not just business
in a lot of cultures you never do business without having fun first
thats why they take you to strip clubs and shit when you do business in asia or south ameria i think only in north america it is pure businesss
you got any ideas
well we cant play with peter
cuz he refuses to play the devils tiles so are you gonna meet peter then he is your good friend
i can ask meng about maj i think he would be down but we need a 4th and then maybe we can meet peter for a meal and take our ultimatum to him
so i would suggest that we first meet to take care of the trip then we play maj and finally we eat dinner with peter
but it will be a pretty full day you got time for that
what the fuck are you so busy with
holy shit ok how about trip  maj only
no meal
i will ask meng and stefan
oh ok
so you wanna plan before the meal
ok where do you want to eat i will invite meng and white stefan
but dont expect white stefan to come
um there are many what kind of food you want
how about chinese ramen or you want jap
i am not a fan of ramen personally but ok
la mian
its cool man we will eat ramen i know u love the japanese shit
what is gyudon the ox heard the ox head yellow place
oh i dont wanna go there again ramen is fine with me
there is the extremely busy one on dundas and a slightly less busy one on baldwin i dont know o any others
i am pretty sure we tried it before
we went there i am fine to go again lemme check the reservation shit they dont take reservations
i dont mind lining up if u want
ok
i enjoyed it i went before wth jamie it is called lan zhou la mian
lol sure thing man that place also has a lineup but much less than sansotei
ok i will tell peter and meng
what time are we going
ok then well do trip before or after
oh shit son that is pretty early
that might be better ya
ok come to my house at 2 or 3pm then we will go eat at 6pm how about that
ok yo my parents want to know your mothers cell phone number cuz they wanna ask about ultrasound for my grandmother
ok whats the number again my parents will call later tonight we are out right now
thanks don
ok you can come at 1 if you want i am going to have a deep think about this trip
let me know when u get here ill come down to get you
ok
oh shit i am coming
yo peter is 100 out he is gonna go with his sister instead
ok i suspected it but now i know for sure
no i sent him one
he replied since we couldnt agree on hotel he is going with his sister
alright
i had been reading the opposite we gotta delve into this further
lemme take a look
wtf is a wow scene
ok to be honest i do love that shit and i think you already know this but i personally will not be able to truly appreciate the alcoholic drinks and the partying life
lemme finish reading the article
i will taste the beer but i am not going to go to a nightclub
ya i am reading that now and yo in this picture apparently they accept euros
ya
ok and they say the exchange ratei s shit so we will need czech crowns dude the first time i saw a czech banknote was in a porn video
apaprently they got lots of prostitutes there
lol
i see it sounds good to me too to be honest lemme just finish the article the one thing that scares me is the crowds i like to be a bit off the beaten path
but it seems prague is a huge beaten path
yo i will certainly be waking real fucking early to getp hotos so if you are cool with that thats fine with me
in the article he recommends prague if we onnly have a few days that sounds like us he spent like 2 months in each city
there are 2 peple who mentioned they wanna travel with us i told them about the plan to go august 114
i am gonna give them a chance to respond but in my opinion they are probably only like 30 each to actually come
no more than a day
i am continuing to read about these cities i am down to take overnight trains as long as theres a sleeper compartment and not just a regular train seat that should save us some money and time
ok
lmao how old was shem an
was she asian
and did she ever make eye contat with you
then i think you got nothing more to read into this situation
ya like i find it highly unlikley she was trying to hit on you she was probably trying to make sure she looked good for her meeting with friends or whatever
shit son thats a day lost
son i agree with you on prague prague and vienna are locked in what do you think of berlin vs munich if we do munich we could potentially also go to switzerland
no no if we are going to swiss we are forced to fly either to or from there
cuz it is furthest from the others
actually i am reading that people sugest berlin over munich they are saying berlin has a lot more history and it is cheaper
ok last question for you
are we gonna do switzerland before munich or stick to the 3 cities
that depends on the train and how long you wanna spend on things are there night trains going to each city
i think if we cant take sleeper trains it will be hard to fit in swiss
god damn really why the fuck not
which are the night trains then
dude check out kalman imre munich to vienna on the way to budapest
and obb night jet
but is there a night train from vienna to prague
and this site says we must reserve ahead for night trains we cannot just buy last minute
ok
well lemme tell ya
yo
my friend tommy will come with us and
alex has yet to respond to me
ya thats exactly who he is
yes tommy zhang
i hope alex will respond real soon anyway i read that prague and munich are doable in 3 days each but there are many things nearby that we can do to y
its close to zurich
so i think its no problem since zurich is well connected but im not sure if we can fit the tim y the time
ya dont forget to count travel time and shit
like i think the cheapest flights leave toronto at 7pm august 1 and arrive august 2 in the morning by the time we check in to a hostel it will be middle of the day august 2
thats true so you are saying to cut out swiss
its 2 hours away
the other natural place is lucerne
but if we want interlaken we need to fly into zurich
why im not disagreeing but i wanna know your thought
we will have no shortage of things to do thats for sure if we skip swiss we can take time to do day trips from the original 3 to the countryside
httpenwikipediaorgwikineuschwansteincastle tommy wants to go here
why man tommy wanted munich and i just told him you wanted munich too
now you gotta make a case for berlin i originally wanted berlin to y
look up the attractions in both and tell me which set you like more munich is known to be more expensive than berlin and berlin has more history thats why i originally wanted berlin
yeah there are also natural things near vienna and prague but perhaps not as famous as neuschwanstein
its pretty famous reddit loves that shit it was a castle built by a king who was inspired by wagner
well we could theoretically rent a car but as i said i agree berlin is a nicer place
so what are the places near munich you are saying are 12 hours way
thats fine with me i will explain to tommy are there night trains from berlin actually if we go to berlin swiss will be impossible so then the decision is made we will go to berlin vienna and prague
yo we need to look up the berlin night train
ya they are in a line berlin  prague  viena so we also need to either fly into berlin and out of vienna or the opposite
wtf the night trains dont run in both directions
the flights are slightly cheaper if we go into berlin and out from vienna
we save 28 lol so we need berlin  prague and prague  vienna night trains god damn the fucking night trains
oh shit there is no night train from berlin to pragu but for some reason the regular train is only 4 hours so we can manage it i dont know why prague vienna is so fucking long
a czech man said that the train dont exist but we can take a 4 hours train i can survive it
yo a return flight can land in toronto at noon on august 14 is that cool with you
well it leaves vienna in the middle of the night at 6am on the 14th
they are about 100 more expensive but if you must do it maybe you can take a separate return flight
ya thats cool
lol alright son the day we leave we will need to leave our hostel at like 3am anyway so the 14th is purely for travel we have the 13th cut short because we need to sleep
that is even more expensive than the 13th i think cuz its a weeken the 14th is a tuesday which is an unusual day for travel
i am just the messenger
the fuck yo you will still help out right
ok well thats done lemme talk to my niggers and see what they say and by the way if alex is coming it will be a last minute addition so we will go on without him
we will assume he aint going and if he last minute wants to go he will buy his own tickets and meet us there
yo
my boy tommy is ready to pull the trigger lets buy the flights right now
ac 878 lx 976 lx 1585 ac 879 for aug 1 and 14 respectively 2 flights each day because there is a transfer involved in zurich
on google flights unles you know a better option
1260 stanley sent a photo this is my search result i am going to buy the first result
i cant link you just enter the search terms i did and you will find it
sure
delta team whats your status
go go go
lemme investigate there areseveral options
i am looking at it but expedia is also an option for an extra 12 we would depart at 9am instead of 6am which would be a bit less stressful you think thats worth ti
yes
the toronto to berlin flight is locked in basically
ok lets dew it go to expedia
ya thats the one
yo wait stop
these niggers at expedia just told me they raised the price by 100 that is fucking bullshit
lemme first see if expedia still has other reasonable options i never seen this shit before
ya i think we will go to swiss dont worry about that man
ya thats the one
dewit
i am gonna ignore it
thats only for the short flight from zurich to berlin you cant choose seats for the long flight toronto to zurich
i see it we need to investigate it further we are allowed a carry on backpack but it might mean we cannot bring any other luggage
in the worst case we can just pay a bit more to store a suitcase or something in the luggage area
ya but swiss airlines usually operates only in nearby places in europe so i guess they dont expect guests to bring that much luggage i already paid for it my bank is in the hole now
gg yo
right now the next step is to reserch the train and the accommodations
and i realized that the prague vienna train is also only 4 hours so there is no need to take anight train unless you want to what do you think
i am asking you do you prefer a night train or a normal train
lol
god damn ok anyway could i task you with something
can you look for a decent hostel in berlin
we need to make sure its within walking distance to a subway station and its probably important to make sure it has air conditioning cuz i know some hostels do not and it is high summer
ya thanks i will put you in charge of berlin son i will task tommy with prague and i will take vienna you can also look into the attractions you want to see in berlin yo
yo i aint sure about that but ok
aint sure that it is not hot enough to rquire ac
per person per night
is that cad or eur
ok would not recommend stayed here in summer when it was around 25 degrees in the day and there was no air con or fan in the room meaning we would all wake up so hot
oh shiet
it doesnt matter how lcose it is ot downtown just needs to be near the subway station
we are likely not gonna return to the hostel during the day
maybe there is a good airbnb
no airbnb is when a person rents out their house  privately a hostel is an official shitty hotel
ok can you check the airbnbs might be better
thanks i am also checking i
here is another httpswwwairbnbcarooms26473011locationberlin2c20germanyadults3children0infants0guests3checkin20180802checkout20180806
oh shit i assumed all apartments had ac
it seems a decent place my only concern is there are 4 beds but only 3 of us
so i wonder if we are paying extra for that bed
oh shit yo
if you believe in this place do it up
how long though
sheit well it depends if you think the price is worth it
well i am looking up berlin weather and it looks like it can get up to 30 c
yes i aint joking
in the next few days it gets up to 30 there it would be colder at night when we sleep
thats only the average 24 could easily fluctuate up to 30
i think airbnb is actually more suitable to our personality than a hostel but if u wanna experience a hostel i am down for it the place you linked me is indeed pretty far the sofa place is closer
httpswwwairbnbcarooms3146531locationberlin2c20germanyadults3children0infants0guests3checkin20180802checkout20180806sq35tjbl how about this it is a bit more ball httpswwwairbnbcarooms17633505locationberlin2c20germanyadults3children0infants0guests3checkin20180802checkout20180806sq35tjbl this is another
ya you know what i am realizing a ton of places dont have it
so maybe we gotta sac it
hostel is cheaper than airbnb
they seem to be similar prices to me
yo its up to you son like hostel is a lot more social and its more disturbed people always coming and going and people who love to party and shit
the cost of transportation is irrelevant but we need to think about the duration they certainly got a ttc pass equivalent for us yo trust me i stayd in many hostels with qing before you will be disturbed
but if you love socializing and shit it can be fun you can always find someone to hang out
i know man i recomend the airbnb yo i need to go outwith family for a bit we can discuss it later
yo i just got home did you pull the trigger on any berlin
ok
oh ya
could you link me up
where is the map for toms place i dont mind a large bed or a sofa bed
rght which one do u want man i think these are both decent
toms bed looks bigger to me thats the only thing and i htink his location is better it seems closer to the subway the u on the map are subway stations oh actually they are both close to subway
yo i think we should just pull the trigger
i wouldnt expect either place to be that quiet given that its downtown either one is fine
ok we got gotz
do you mind paying for this whole thing tommy and i will each pay for another city and then we can calculate the difference and reimburse the amounts
ya i think this is good man i hope gotz is a g
why the fuck can we not check in til 7 that is total bullshit
i think thats an important consideration
we arrive at airport at 10 which means we will probably get to the place at 1130 or noon so ya i guess 1pm is much better but i thought you already booke with gotz
can you ask him if we can check in sooner
got z
i thought you loved gotz
alright i trust you man can you link me toms place again
thanks you pulled the trigger on tom
ok
ya i think so too and tommy will be coming on a later flight anyway
he arrives in berlin 4 hours after we do and he leaves vienna 2 hours after we do he is flying from vancouver nigger
he is a west side goon
ya lets do it son
oh shit eh ummmm honestly no
i dont want to wait on tommy
thanks man
alright great im going to look into prague now
ya we can leave on the train early in the morning it might be a scenic ride
yo tommy just found this place in vienna httpswwwairbnbcarooms15725593locationvienna2c20austriaadults3checkin20180810checkout20180814sumhbhonr looks like we can sleep with some hot girls there
it is a shithole to be honest man lol but i dont mind it
it is the living room of a place that people have already rented out lmao
they are squeezing people in there it is probably literally illegal because its a fire hazard to have so many people in there
ya i noticed that too we are proably gonna take the morning train so no lemme ask tommy about this but other than that are you okay with this place
johanna looks hot man
it would be the 3 of us living with 3 students who rented out that place for themselves
ya i will accept it and it could be fun to meet some locals
lmao i am just joking man
we are definitely not gonna fuck our airbnb host and one of them is a man yo what is the status with the berlin airbnb i have been doing more reading i am just throwing some ideas out there
ok sounds good but tommy wants me to book the airbnb today can i skip your consultation
ok
i was asking you because we could consider downshifting berlin to 3 days but honestly we iwll make it owrk so fuck it
i will make an executive decision on this shit if you dont care much either way
ya i understand i am okay with it but i would also be okay with 3 days
but if we have extra time we can always go on a day trip
so really its not a big deal
ok
shit son i got 3 responses from prague and they all said we can check in early
ya i can link you in a few minutes httpswwwairbnbcarooms15482391 httpswwwairbnbcarooms17733629 httpswwwairbnbcarooms8885854 here are the 3 options oh shit actually the lukas  petra one already got taken by another group shiet yo i need to respond at 1pm
should we pay extra money to get closer to the city center in prague it is around 35 cad extra per person covering the 4 days
one place is like 40 per person per night the other s 67 look at the places i linked you above peter  terezas place vs the single girls place i gotta go for a few min
by transport but it is 1 hour walk one good thing about the villa is that it has a laundry service and i am pretty sure i am gonna hav to do laundry at least once
it is 15 minute by public transport not by walking god damn that tom
i am fine with gotz did he respond
shit no son
ok stanleyliligmailcom and ill ask tommy
sure thing man there were no cheaper options in berlin eh
shit son ok yo would you be willing to accompany me to take photos at night like at night like 4am
god damn dont make me cry
tommyzhang94hotmailcom thats his email son and whats your email you used for airbnb i might need it too
yo i just booked a place in prague you shoulda just got an email about it any update from gotz i havent got an email confirming that booking
god damn why did you ask for me email then can you forward us the confirmation anyway just so we are all working with the same info
yo did gotz say we can do early checkin or just early luggage drop off cuz tommy is arriving at a different time so we gotta make sure it works for him too
no he is arriving at airport at 2 so he will probably arrive at gotz house at 34
ok sure tommy is a man who wants to be prepared
lmao
for example we might be able to leave our luggage only but not get the key until later
its fine if he says we can get the key early cuz we can just meet tommy at the place when he arrives with our key the key is key
not much i am trying to pump shit out in the lab im excited for our trip you get any research done for berlin
no but from now on i will need to
did you tell gotz our arrival time
all thats left is to get bus tickets between cities and make a schedule of where to visit we can divide up that work again i can take care of the tickets
um we will need to research it i hope not cuz thats a lot of clothing to bring for one thing
yeah we can consider seeing concert in prague if vienna is too baller
i still wanna go but im saying if the vienna ticket is too expensive we can think about alternatives
i cant see shit its just a black screen
yes
yo i saw howard liu on the street yesteray he told me he was working as an accountant at ey he seemed to be proud of that he said his friend opened a new bar at spadina and dundas
nah maybe it is my mac
misbah lalani from vic lol i aim to socialize while im in toronto and have the chance son
you should go meet some girls you can introduce me to my waifu
oh really eh just not in the mood
by the way i gotta tell you that tommy is a christian man so we need to cut down on talking shit about girls
like we cant say that we are gonna fuck bitches or go to the brothel
but you can talk about marriage and wives
lmao you can actually say whatever you want just saying that tommy is not interested in talking about casual girls
i have questioned his faith before no he doesnt he is a very kind and innocent guy he always has a positive attitude
yeah but i also want us to have a good time just keep it tasteful
btw are you planning to bring your laptop with you to europe
are you serious son
i aint gonna waste my precious travel time watching something like that but thats cool but i aint gonna let you hold me back
lolol ok thats fine i can just go with tommy if that happens
lol no issue then son im interested to see what you and tommy think of each other
lololol maybe you can rub off on each other
maybe he will question yours
lmao but you speak those biblical quotes because they are epic not because you believe in the divinity of them
anyway i trust your judgement to not give him a hard time
lol thats interesting you need to cut someone real deep eh
yo i wanna ask you about the berlin shits i wanna know why you wanna go to the jewish museum cuz its not a very well rated place
from what i read its about the jews in berlin before ww2 to be honest i aint interested in that
but if you feel strongly we should go ill go
ya it would be impossible did you add the places i sent you last time
how about the neues museum there is a famous bust of an egyptian queen
nice good shit son
the zoo what the fuck
and the aquarium berlin isnt even a coastal city how can they have a nice aquarium
i love aquariums too but i just have no faith in this one from a landlocked city
but i would rather go to aquarium than zoo
no i would rather go to aquarium than zoo if we gotta go to one cuz i have no interesti n zoo
i just feel like those things they got in all cities evne in canada but in berlin they got some mad history and we dont have it here
what about some food places
i guess we can fin some legit places nearby we dont have to plan it in advance
i just want to avoid tourist traps and taste some authentic shit
httpswwwtripadvisorcarestaurantreviewg187323d718383reviewstiergartenquelleberlinhtml this is a highly rated and cheap place lets check it out
oh like what
we have to book in advance why the fuck
ah shiet ok well it dont matter to me
lets just book them on a day that is not the switzerland or concentration camp day
we have to book the museum that is insanity to me we cant just go in
shiet
i think one of our days in berlin is a weekend so maybe one of those are closed
btw what is switzerland like what are we gonan do there
who is thomas oh tommy ok
lol
shit good night yo son whats up
on what
i just came home from a first aid recertification course
i met a beautiful white girl there she did mouth to mouth on me
no i am trolling your ass  but she was quite attractive
when she leaned over me to practice her hair fell in my face
and it was very arousing
but i had to play it cool man cant jsut whip it out
shit
lmao l m  a  oooo she was fucking fine man
yo she dont look that hot anymore what a shame
ya
i just loked her up on fb
nah not really but i love dem white girls man
i controlled that shit like a monk i thought about all the islands i visited in my life and i kept it under control
lol
i heard there is a mountain in that german forest
just a rock formation idk what its called but tommy seems real keen on visiting it he is from bc so i guess he loves natures
ya its cool we can go my priority is to see the historical shit in berlin if we can do it then im happy i am not optimistic about the german food it has a reputation for being bland
lol  no man i was a pussy i dont think she liked me she just aroused me thats all
lol whats wrong with that you can still sleep with her
why not you should just go ask her out
thats sad man dude you have access to all these girls you should take advantage
you dont need to know them well to get a date
no dude you had 2 girlfriends before how do you lack the skill
probably same thing son we are on the same flight right
ya i havent talked about it yet if he aint free i can take the up express my fathers work schedule isnt always clear ahead of time but its likely he can drive me
lol ya see u then son its gonna be a good trip i pray you dont troll tommy too hard he is an innocent boy and do not say racist shit in germany
lol
ok man as long as we all have a good time i will be pleased
he is taller than me and probably smarter than me
but he aint about fighting he is a peaceful man and works hard
lmao he is 2 years below us he is a perfect son the kind of guy you would marry to your daughter
lmao i mean he aint a perfect man nobody is but he hits a lot of the points a traditional asian parent would want
well you are gonna find out man
son send me your email you would like to use
i am forwarding you a few tickets
ok dude i been resaerching prague hard we are gonna do some hipster shit stay away from the big crowds
just off the beaten path
cuz one of the main complaints is that the city is too crowded with tourists so i wanna make sure we dont have to line up for bad shit
its up to you man i am fine with anything
as long as we can eat some good food and go to the places i sent you i am satisfied i dont wanna walk into no tourist trap restaurants
well we still have a week its cool
ya we can also do the research the night before like at the airbnb just map out where to eat the next day
pick some places close to our itinerary good luck with exams
i am also pretty busy with wrapping up resaerch dude i swear i am never gonna do rsearch ever again i fucking hate this shit
god damn you have the passion eh
damn man that is adventurous of you my mother is totally against black girls how was she different from you man you gotta tell me more
so what is your expectation in talking to her it sounds like you might not be the best fit in terms of personality do you find her physically attractive
lol in my opinion its a waste of both peoples times to chat up someone who you dont think will get along with you even for a short relationship unless the goal is to have casual sex
honestly if we are being serious if someone is not interested in being intellectual i gotta rule it out but to be honest i dont think i care as much as you about industrious
how do you know that son
shit son dont be so judgmental
but i agree with you that work at that life stage is not what i am looking for in a partner but i mean you cant blame someone for being in thatp osition
well you were asking how the fuck she got there at age 28
lol no son there is just no way you could know exactly the reasons
though i believe you could speculate and be probably right about many of the reasons but it wouldnt be right of you
thats right i mean no you can speculate all you want but what use is there the fact is she is in that situation in life and it is a situation you dont find attractive
ya fair enough sometimes  i am interested in these apps and sometimes i am not
no it reminded me of why i fucking hate research every time i think i make a good progress someone gives me feedback that i gotta do way more work so i lost motiation motivation
i think you are totally right man
i think im capable of doing all the isolated skills in research like reading and running experiments and presenting but i never had a good ability to keep the big picturei n mind
i love research in theory cuz i like speculating and i like learning new things but its hard for me to motivate myself with the thought that one day dwn the road i might help discover some cool shit
like when someone gave me a key piece of feedback instead of thinking wow thats a good point good thing we caught that and guarded our research against that pitfall i thought fucking shit now i gotta do way more work before we can publish this
like what i cant think of another example right now yo i am gonna walk for a bit but you can keep typing i will beo n my phone
damn son thats some real talk thats some valuable insight you got there man appreciate it
i do take you seriously but i have no idea how to motivate myself
lol son please please trash talk me i wanna hear what you have to say
yo read this story httpswwwbbccomnewsstories44601030 we could go visit the place in berlin
son there aint no more wall and it was really long so we would need to know the location of that treehouse but we can figure it out our berlin schedule isnt that full right
yo son fyi i called the airline and we can bring 2 pieces of luggage 1 to store in the cargo bay and 1 to carry on the carry on like a backpack cannot exceed 8kg
you do it at the airport its real easy
around 4 and be btw
do not mention prostitutes or shit around tommy cuz i dont wanna look like a thirsty man keep it pg please
ill see you at the airport
yo did you get your boarding pass before lining up for the bag check or can they give it to you
well im not following instructions anymore followed some airport staff
send me the berlin airbnb address please i might have to take another flight but still hoping to get on the original
httpswwwbigboytravelcomczechrepublicpraguefreewalkingtour httpthecreativeadventurercomblogselfguidedwalkingtourofprague stanley sent an attachment yo son meet us at the restaurant called u magistra kelly at 1230pm we have a reservation for that time and we left you the keys lunch is also in that district
ok cool its a beautiful neighborhood yo could you please look up the way to take public transit to the airport google aint working at this restaurant specifically to arrive there at 4am at the latter latest
ok son lets uber or taxi
lets see how long it takes and we can make a plan wait can you book an uber in advance
do you have uber app
lets calculate how long it takes to drive to the airport and aim to arrive there at 330
a m son lets just book it for 3am then if it only takes 30 min or 245 is fine too
no but we got the food and were working diligently you can shower right now if you like
thanks son ill get up at 215 tomorrow
ill meet you there soon then we can go to dinner together
i think you took the conversation too serious yesterday you thought we were attacking your beliefs but we were just talking about the situation and about what was right for peter
she did a good job on the poster did you ask her to present to you
i wouldnt expect her to but its good to hear she was a confident presenter she is not very confident in reality but she can put on a show
she aint that white washed around the same as me maybe a bit more with regard to her spending habits but she still keeps many aspects of chinese culture
stanleyliligmailcom
thanks man what the hell is blackmother
ill take your word for it what did you talk about with tina today my sister said she saw her too
did she talk about her boyfriend
ok
i am curious if her boyfriend is asian or white i am 95 sure he is actually white but i dont wanna ask directly
ya i undertsand
thats a pretty common way of greeting
i think you gotta let the girl initiate it otherwise it might seem aggressive
its just how you gotta presnt in reality she didnt know that much about her project even though she worked hard she got unlucky with a bad supervisor
lmao frank dont feel too bad you got some pussy in the past you can do it again and you are going to the land of widespread prostitution
later
yo remove the uber from the calculations we aint gonna take tommys money for that and i already paid you my half in euros
i paid you in cash in euros you told me it was 30 euros so i gave you 15 it was in the airport or after we got off the uber
that is something i am 100 sure about
son i just sent you the money too i think you will know the password when you see it
dude lol think about it you just etransferred me a few days ago it is the same password you are the one who invented it so i would think you remember
gg son
dud lmao
my ass is getting wrecked man i dont know shit about anything today was my first day in the operating room
it was pretty interesting but i also didntk now shit in those 2 year you learn some basic shit and you also forget a lot
ya but i am tired from the day so it is difficult to have energy to do that at home
today i worked 8 to 330 then lecture until 330 to 530
we will see and what the hell is this anime bullshit
how many pages is it
lol the premise seems so stupid this reminds me of the spiral horror story
that actually scared me when i first read it but i am a changed man
yo lol i just finished it it was a funny twist but honestly it wasnt as scary as the spirals
dude i cant see shit here
im glad to haer there are some nice girls in japan but i cant tell based on those photos tell me about your experience so far man
surely theres gotta be more than that looking forward to hearing about your adventures as for me i survived the first week the doc said i was doing fine hes a very nice guy
you have to rest son you cant be working all day like that there are no suitable girls at work
oh really you are working in a foreigners place
yo that is perfect they have no supports in japan either they will be looking for friends and the girls gonna be looking for the d
i am so jealous man
aint no girls looking for d here
dude trust me in a few weeks they will need it
cuz everyone needs sex
they will be starved in a foreign country there are way more people who speaks their language here
and most already have partners but in japan
you need to show them the way
anyway i am going to get to work now have fun over there man
lmao ok my friend i heard there was an earthquake in hokkaido did that affect you
well today my preceptor got tricky with me he asked me some questions that i probably should have known but i didnt so i got rekt he let me do a bit of stitching for the patient
that is what we call them today i heard from a friend that another friend i know who is an asian dude in london is fucking a girl in his class
but it made me think god damn maybe that could have been me if i were in london
lmaoo ya i am dying of thirst out here son
aint nobody coming to save me
well i know both of them they are both my classmates in lodnon
not from u of t like that girl aint that hot but i would probably fuck her if i had the chance
i thought it depends on the positions you are using
lol i see
well that girl is like a 4 or 510 for me
thats a great attitude hopefully they are hot friends
i found that when i am in a new place i feel the freedom to act more like the person i want to be
however if im caught off guard and i behave according to my old patterns i find its easy to settle into old patterns so you gotta be vigilant about acting the way you want to be

ok good luck
today i met a pediatrics resident
she was pretty hot
and i just stalked her on facebook and turns out she used to be a pro gymnast god dam
well ya
lol well its not a competition i have enjoyed many hours of my wasted time
hell yes
well i just stalked her and she appears to be single
but she is from london like she is only here for a few weeks to learn then she will be back in london and i think she is older than me but i would smash her
she is real short actually most gymasts are short and she was wearing baggy clothes so i couldnt see her sizes but in her pics she has decent tits
she was wearing those surgery clothes scrubs

what a shame
i just wanted to talk about girls and forget my troubles oh shit that sounds fun man its great that youre going
yo my status is the weekend i played badminton today and ate some chinese foods with my friends i finished my first rotation on monday i am starting neurosurgery its gonna be hardcore
no neurosurgery is too intense i want to do neurology it is the non surgical side good luck with the tinder
yo today my supervisor told me i did a good job today that was good shit man
it actually motivates me to keep studying
sometimes positive feedback is actually helpful typically i respond well to negative feedback
yeah sure i guess you can compare it like that tell me all about japan and the people you work with
thats fucking intense did
i wanted to do that with you but now youve already done it
more tiring than our europe trip
how much did it cost you
that aint even that bad a hike how many hours did you spend hiking
holy shit 10 uphill hours
thats fucked
yeah you got altitude sickness who did you go with
dude you have to tell me about the girls
did you fuck anyone
lol i love dat thicc ass dress isnt that important to me
lmao
you are a legend son
lol yo just you always gota be respectful even if you are way better
ya thats goo d i think you learned your lesson in the past eh
ya thats good so you are working only with canadians tell me about the girls from canada
yo show me a pic
she sounds hot as fuck
god damn she sounds french all the french girls are ot hot
ah shit son
we will see later
the result was good so you fucked her
what she do
interesting maybe she can find you a job
tell me about her personality
you still gonna date herm
i think its not worth it
youre only there for one year so you gotta go fast
show me her pictures
btw its typically a trap if someone had just 1 picture no face
either they are bots or they are so shy that theres no point of trying i know and look where you are its a waste of time in my opinion
most girls in japan wont date you
because of that cultural shit
i told you man you gotta get into the pants of those canadian girls
they are white probably and they attract those adventurous girls who want to date foreigners the same shit would happen in china you got people who love the whites and others who will only keep in their own rac
yes dude i had the same experience in china there were very hot girls but they were also sexually conservative and didnt want to date a fake chinese man and we gotta deal with it
you would need to be totally whitewsehd and have a nice body to have a chance with a white girl i have seen it on the streets of toronto before and those guys make me jealous every time
that isnt enough tbh ok gn
im gonna do a bit of photo editing today and im gonna email the pics with you in them to you the pics will slowly start to trickle in i hope you can appreciate the artistic quality
lol thanks dude i enjoyed taking them i have some decent ones for myself too
dude i just lost a huge chance man a girl liked me on hinge and she thought my joke was funny hinge is a dating app
but i accidentally swiped left and she was an irish princess too
on hinge you can see if girls like you
no
its a shame but realistically i doubt anything would have happened i dont even think paying money can let you undo it
i dont think so
what a huge shame man i only know a few things about her her name was rose
she works as a consultantpa which i think is a personal assistant at various comedy clubs she is from toronto and went to york university and she likes zouk which from my research is a brazilian dance
and she went to shenzhen so maybe she likes the chinese guys yeah thats totally true but she was an irish princess i cant say no to that
god damn i am full of regret this morning
i got a notification this morning that a very beautiful girl liked me
actually to be totally honest she was very short 51 and she might have been a little fat but i couldnt tell
lol but man suneil kalia my pi once told me that in his business you need to eat failures like they aint nothing cuz it is full of failures and wastes so i am gonna take his advice
i am going to work now later son
yo are you around i need your input on something real quick
leme send u 2 pics tell me which is better
stanley sent a photo stanley sent a photo
tell me why
ok fair enough thanks for your input
she is good looking i probably wouldnt marry someone like that but if you can fuck her its all good go for it son youre only in japan for a short time
lmaooo got is a very well produced show everything is just technically excellent
i gotta pause on the photos i have been working now 14 days in a row and i gotta work 19 in a row before i get a break
yes thats why its 14 days
it is totally fucking insane
thanks man i will get back to you about the photos when i get a chance but to be honest i think the best ones were from germany anyway
any girls
careful about that man you can fake it but then the girl will find out
i gotta get back to work son
no rest for my ass
how are you my son today i got a hard dose of reality my friends and i were talking about our experience with online dating and my friend showed me his coffee meets bagel app like god damn
thats some real talk right there man easier said than done
yes its hard to drag my ass to the gym i am tired all the time and busy with other shit
lmao shit i better pump my pythons
dude things are too busy right now sorry but i already sent you the best ones in my opinion time for you to slay dat japanese pussy
ohooooo
lmao man how expensive is that do they provide prostitutes or do you have to bring your own
do they have sex dolls
you gotta take me there when we go to japan
shit but what about them hoes
my money is no good in japan
how else am i gonna get the practice though
god damn son i am stuck
gg
that aint that expensive but only 1 hour and those hotels are probably dirty as hell and its got aids everywhere if we go to japan we need to find a clean love hotel
theres more aids in japan than canada i bet
its just what i heard about asia and there a ton of whoring there
because the men cant get pussy
you can get it from semen too it is just speculation
lmao you still gotta watch out
they dont have those realistic sex dolls i am playing skyrim
you mean the dolls or the game
lmao ya i guess its not so much coping with stress as just having something different to do and it is an excellent game the world building in the elder scrolls is very deep
i like that idea just write it like your honda application
shit this man is industrial pumping out essays like pumping out loads at the love hotels
you keep it all internal youll be having lots of children
shit son
not really i am also slow its a lot easier to edit even a shit essay than to write a new one
theres no way i can look at this until this weekend cuz i am too fucking busy send it to me again this weekend son and ill see what i can do
i didnt like it the sound quality was very thin and tinny there wasnt much variation in tone or dynamics or rhythm whats your opinion about it
lol damn son i wouldnt be that harsh im not surprised to hear its an ai generated piece and that just proves i guess that ai has lots to improve on before they match the human masters
then gg the human masters are still ahead in this area at least i think visual art is an area that will probably be one of the first art forms to be mastered by ai
there are many apps one is called vinci
you upload a photo to the app then you can choose several processing options for example make it look like an oil painting or a charcoal drawing
if they gotta start from scratch it might be harder
will it happen in our lifetime
we got robots all around what kind of robot
sentient ai thats a dangerous road
maybe man yo
have you considered playing mtg arena
they dont have a friends feature yet but when they get one i wanna fight you
what do you say
currently they dont have a feature where you can play with friends so you can only play vs randoms
wtf it is online magic but not modo its a newly released game
it looks more like haerthston
and it currently only has 5 most recent sets legal it is free but you need to collect cards you only get some starter decks at the beginning and you can draft for free once every several days
ya i  am  interested inti
yeah sure man that sounds fun maybe she will want to have sex after
the hell is that yeah you should definitely go its a cultural experience at least
but when a girl invites you for dinner she wants you to invite her for the d i am pretty sure
i aint trolling like in china this situation happened to me there was a girl who i hung out with a lot but i think she might have wanted the d
ya its less certain than it would be in the west thats my opinion
yeah i think its a good attitude but watch out for clues she wants the d like no matter where you go we are all humans and most humans like sex
god damn i am so jealous of you man shagging all the girls in honda
then you need to hit up the honda
then get your ass to that corner son no i mean the international students
then hit up whoever is left
shit dude honestly being a young student in a foreign country is such a great chance to hit up girls
people always love the novelty of a foreigner
shit son i wish i had that skill
its also the sex appeal of tall white guys and there are complex historical and media representation reasons for that
holy shit you never hear that on western news eh we always think japan is the civilized jewel of asia
thats fucked dude stay safe
why man lol
thats so fucked on many levels my dude
ya ok just looking out for you next thing you know this man goes missing in japan your mother is gonna call me and i gotta tell her that her son thought with his dick in japan
lmao your mother will be grieving for you
most chinese families dont want their lineage tainted with dirty jap blood there is still a lot of hatred in the older generation
ya i know they are but you gotta know its a rarity
dude this hatred is from like 1945 that shit aint gonna be forgotten and the japanese government is making things worse by refusing to acknowledge their war crimes so this shit aint never gonna be over
no man i aint wrong i dont hate the japanese people but the governments policies about wwii is wrong
yes
speaking just for myself i dont like the jap govt policies im okay with japanese people assuming they are not brainwashed by the govt policies
but many chinese people wont draw that line its easy to hate indiscriminately there are definitely contemporary disputes but the history is a huge issue too
i think everyone should take it seriously you gotta own and learn from your history germany showed a great example of that when we went
but the japanese response is the total opposite of germanys
its not text they got memorials to war criminals and the govt officials visit them to pay respects thats not acceptable they are an industrialized country for sure and they have many great cultural exports
no man thats totally wrong
ya it happens all the time you ignore some shit and its forgotten about but we are talking about a huge scale war crime here thats like saying we should forget about 911
do we forget about ww2 right now that was over 50 years ago
you can choose not to care about this issue but it doesnt change the fact that it is a huge issue for many people in the world and i am explaining to you why it is a huge issue
some people might but a lot of chinese people wont forget that shit
how so
god damn you can dig her gold
lmao true take the lead son lead us to the gold
it is getting wrecked dude this year has been insane i am learning a fair bit though so thats good
but i am still very far from being knowledgeable
lmaoooo
send it to me this friday i will look at it then
this coming friday i will be less busy in 5 days
how did you hear about that movie what the hell i thought you had one month to do it
ok man i understand that thinking sorry i couldnt help you this time
never heard of it
but man you never liked fps games
you cans boot camp
you gotta play half life 2 it is the best fps of all time
you need to play black mesa it is the remake of hl1 in a better engine
the environments are excellent i also love the elder scrolls for world building they are masterpieces
yes do it up sonâ¡
alright i will check it out next time
how the hell you gonna go there if youre in japan
lmao dude i do not recommend making career decisions based on girls it sounds like you would rather do the programming jobs
why is that
he heard the absolute truth but he is also famous for being highly unsuccessful in relationships and he more than likely has some social problems are these jobs for a coop or you are gonna quit your degree
so right after you return from japan
are you doing any more course based education or is it purely coop
ok
right right yo lemme tell you i find it unlikely they will offer you the job on the spot most employers will wait and go through official channels even if they love you
ya exactly so i dont think its a big concern but if they do
then you gotta say thank you for the offer you really appreciate their time for chatting with you and for their willingness to take you on and you gotta say yes
ya but frank to be dead honest with you
from what i know there are more opportunities in life sci blended with computers than in game design
game design is actually infamous for paying people like shit and having a culture that overworks you
and i think you are in a great spot with a dual degree to work in biocompsci so i wouldnt discount the pmh thing so uick quick
anyway just go kill the interview and dont think too far ahead they might fire your ass unless you wow them
exactly my son
lmaoo
dude you are too red
the colour philosophy of magic
red is about emotions love self expression but also recklessness instinct
the colour philosophy guides me when i am doing analysis of peoples personality you are grixis just like nicol bolas
lmao tell them they gotta sac their grant and give all the money to you
lmao frank man that is kind of fucked honestly you are a good candidate but there are always better candidates you just gotta hope that those guys arent applying at the same time and work on make yourself better
damn son your 2 extra degrees are just taking a huge shit on all those fresh faced high school grads eh
lol be careful with confidence its good to have it but not too much
you need to give me some of your confidence
looool
i am making a spirit bomb and i gotta drain some of your energy
later son
what about it
i am not extremely pro but i know my shit actually i just owned up my class in a neuro lecture recently that felt good man tbh cuz usually i am not the most knowledgeable
we study the basics of perception in terms of how the senses work but higher level perception is still mysterious and mostly dealt with by psychologist
never heard of it those theories are also more psychology based so we would have learned it in psy100 i know that color perception is affected by language
no i done much more basic than high level basic is like cell bio anatomy function thats much more relevant to us than psychology theories what do you need to know son
ok sure what are you going with the idea
that is cool shit man i wanna do this in the future
ill have to be a consultant
lol i dont know how much i can charge it would just be for fun
i wouldnt be a scientist
it depends what kind of knowledge they need we will see i actually love research and science but i hate doing the grunt work it would be fun to just sit and think and chat about science
thats true science is too much work i just want to enjoy my life
thats super complicated first you need to understand the sensory pathways that give him the stimulus of being hit that gets processed in association areas of the cortex that integrate simpler inputs and interprets them
no problem i think if you try to go that deep you wont find much that amount of detail is probably still a mystery to us but generally all the higher functions like language are in the cortex
its an interesting subject
i am we just finished exams this week i was extremely stressed
it wasnt the worst ever so im fine but i appreciate your concern my son
thanks for believing in me how are things in japan tell me about all the experiences youre having
you are really a self directed guy
what is the dinner with the young courtesans
dude you should fuck her what a fantasy man going down to a foreign country and seducing all the girls
that simplifies things hump and dump i have had some matches online but its hard for me to take anything seriously
because i spend most of my time in windsor and i dont even know when im gonna be in toronto
december 24 to jan 1
damn when are you here
lol i dont know about that man honestly it is hard
sometimes sometimes i am so hopeless that i ignore the match
yeah i know but i gotta be really attentive to take chances usually im tired or stressed and then i dont do things outside my comfort
400km son
its uncomfortable for me to try to have a serious conversation with someone im not convinced i should care about its hard cuz you gotta commit more than is reasonable to commit to get anywhere
i dont wanna pretend you know what im going to send some messages right now you just inspired me
later son
its not bad its almost vacation time for me and im excited about it i just played axe in dota for the first time and it was fucking fun
we wrecked some guys with axe it is not fully 10 man so we usually get 35 stack it is fun they are not as toxic as meng
say it
it is definitely rude of you to cancel on her but this lady dont mean much to you its fine that you cancelled on her i wouldnt worry much about it
its fine son you are doing fin e how are things in japan you discover anything new
god damn frank you are having the time of your life over there
i hope i can experience some of that one day too dude i truly want to go to japan with you in the future
god damn tat will take a few years
what about you son you aint rich but you are having a good time
ya well in a few years i want to enjoy what japan has to offer
lmao it will take a long time a hell of a long time and i aint joking about the pinsaro
lol you dont know wher to look
lol yo i am out for tonight send me sme more pics if you got some interesting ones
i wanna see what you are doing in japan
np
stanley ó° nice photos of your girls and you decided to keep the offer
yo i have the capability to you wanna play
today
i just got back to my toronto house a few hours ago i am off until jan 1
shit son
an old master has risen from his slumber to carry my ass into 2019 what a great honour
actually ya your ping will be shit lol i started playing carry
wow g arena that is from way back i can hardly believe that we first played dota 1 almost 10 years ago it feels like just yesterday i cant believe so much time has passed since those carefree days
shit son that is deep yo so are you still workin injapan or just enjoying the holiday cuz we gotta synch our dota times since we are 12 hours away
are you serious so n so when are we gonna play
i cna play right now is it saturday morning for you if you download i can play right now i am real shit i gotta warn you maybe slightly better tahn before
nice man
i got a stack a few stacks
ya maybe
my dad is working in china right now and my mom trusts me cuz i am a good son
he is doing some contract work there
what is the status of your dota
you aint coming home for xmas
thats too ad bad whens the next time youre gonna be in toronto
i will see you then i got a more relaxed schedule in the summer months i will try to make it back to toronto a few times
steam is fucked right now but hopefully it will recover
nah it is cool
my aunts family is here so i cant play until they leave maybe 9 or 10pm
yo i am here now
ok son
lemme see come into discord son you wanna play
yo i am here
i agree neurosurgery is the most fascinating field but it requires you to work too hard i know many neurosurgeons from research and clinical experience and i can see they all live under extreme stress
no it is difficult to switch its one downside of medicine its a very on rails career you take it like a train and just go down the tracks already put in place for you
well its what i chose it has ups and downs
what part did you get to that made you say that it is one of the best stories ever dreamed up by man
yeah fair enough well im glad youre enjoying the show now
friday night i have a friends birthday celebration to go to why
ill play if im back early enough yo i can play now if you are free
ok we will see then
im down to but we are having a big chinese family holiday party at my house i can play after the guests leave
yo they still here son
ya its my moms friends annual gathering we played riichi mahjong but simplified the rules for new players
son it might not be possible to play today im sorry we just finished cleaning the house from the guests and we are gonna sleep soon
anything new in japo
are you serious tell me all the deets
yeah its not a bad idea man maybe you will get some pussy
i played with my sister and my parents friends kids
20 and 28 show me pictures of that girl is she hot
why does it matter if she wants kids isnt it unlikely that you marry this random girl i thought you are just trying to have fun
i think she is fine personally i hate smoking and i would not consider dating a smoker seriously i see you are a very serious man when it comes to relationships
i wouldnt mind to simply fuck a smoker as long as they dont smell like smoke
that is just a less extreme form of smoking but you are right
for dota
tomorrow i will have lunch with family then go for a walk with jamie then meet dk and bernard ma for dinner monday i will play magic if all goes according to plan
ya maybe or even as the year goes on i can play in windsor too whats the plan for your date where will you meet her
in japan
shit son would you be okay with a black girl
gordon tattle has a half black half white girlfriend and she is extremely hot i would be cool with a girl like that
alexi believe dont know her last name they might be engaged or married now
i think they were together since third year uni and i assume they still are if so its about time to get engaged gordon was extremely smart
hes an engineer
he bought a condo with alex at yonge and eg i dont know what kind
lol same dude
i am further from the girlfriend than from the condo
i saw an extremely hot argentinian girl on hinge today recommended to me i sent her a message but she is too hot for my ass
yeah ive thought about it particularly i need to improve my physical shape but i think im good enough with myself to start dating these days there are just so many hot girls
i just want a young honey but i require that they be mature and good communicators and smart
what do you mean
i dont really agree with you first of all a girls beauty i dont think is that well correlated with how skilled a guy is at getting girls and my social skills are decent
ok
and we are also low dating status
so why are we low status
thats true but i also dont think we are definitely missing something it is unclear
i cant but i also cant say we are
and yo you have had 2 girlies already that aint bad
you cant always have what you want sometimes it takes time and everything in life takes luck too
from my viewpoint it is much better than nothing
lol i will talk to you for sure
i will accept that
yo i really like your definition of confidence tell me about our different weaknesses i am always curious to see what other people think about me
ya thats pretty accurate i am rarely very close with female friends maybe cuz i am worried that things will be perceived as a date or that i am interested in them
i like it when things are peaceful also i cant lay a physical smackdown on anybody and i have never been in a serious physical confrontation
lmao ok i think this is getting too far down the wrong track cuz there are tons of guys who dont have to confront nobody to get girls
lol i mean i dont nkow there are honestly no girls i know right now in my life that i am really sure i want to give it a shot with
but that runs the risk of sending a message and they might be creeped out and try to keep their distance
maybe but you gotta consider social norms too like if i ask a girl friend to get lunch with me alone everyone in western society will at least raise their suspicions as to my intentions and with tiff
right now i have no inteded target i would have to start from scratch with online dating and usually you would go for coffee instead of a meal anyway man its fun to speculate and analyze our behaviour
i think it is hopeless for me
and it is very difficult for you too we are both in places where the types of girls likely to be a good long term fit for us are not plentiful
on online dating it is almost purely white girls
and white girls do not like asian guys
makes me sad cuz i love white girls looks
thats right and i am not looking forward to that
even chines egirls or white girls who will date asian guys
ya
i think ottawa would be a fine place for girls smae for toronto vancouver and probably also london and calgary but then you start to get kind of thin like halifax winnipeg would be difficult hamilton probably okay
you gotta realize i am in a pretty rare position of being culturally inbetween western and chinese culture the fobs and international students and even the asian girls who have 100 asian friends are too asian for me
so i either need a white girl who understands my cultural position and is okay with it or a chinese girl who is similar to me and not too whitewashed but not too chinese
lmao dude absolutely not
first of all i think the majority of them are setn by rich parents and i place a very high value on language and communication skills
i doubt that
i think i would be able to tell in a deep and complex discussion maybe i am more picky than you are
in fact i dont doubt that i think my pickiness has been one factor in my failure so far
lol you just foud another problem i have i never put in a lot of effort
lmao dude you are right about the effort the last thing i truly spent a lot of effort in was completing my msc so that i could go to medical school and that is my dream
no i dont think so
and that is because i am not hot i am not successful yet at least and generally white girls dont find asian guys attractive
you cant look past those 2 things though they are critical attributes
true
i will admit that right now i am not in good physical shape and i think girls like that so if i am to improve one thing i should do is improve my physical condition
yo you are dead fucking wrong it is not easy to focus on and it is not easy to achieve at least it has been difficult for me personally
man i wish you could man i actually go to the gym in windsor with friends but we are all busy it is extremely difficult to go after a work day
you know what generally i believe i am quite a capable person in many areas
but i dont put forth as much effort as i could and the gym is one area where perhaps i could do it but i need to try harder
and i have been living a wasteful life
shit son i think you might be right son i am free to play dota tonight if you want
thats cool
tomorrow night might work not morning
at least we should have a chat if we dont game its good to chat with your mouth
instead of your fingers stanley ó°
are you talking about the stanley ó°
cuz that was just an accident lmao
its asian culture to use emotes isnt it
it is annoying id rather see them in swimsuits
lmao you see any in japan
that kinda porn is hard to find
trust me i have done my research
shiiiiet
yo you gotta show me your stash
but only 3d uncensored stuff
holy shit these gravure girls are hot as hell
ok late
we could when are you free
ok i think i will pass today
yo whats up man
lol damn you liking that show honestly it is a great show i just dont like how the plot strays from the book in later seasons yo tell me why you cant wait to come back
damn son i fucking thought so japan aint the same as you remember from your childhood canada is a great country to live in but you are lucky to have the opportunity to study in japan
that summer i may be happy or in deep shit depend on how my residency match goes stanley ó° oops
thanks man but life is hard to predict
these days it is even possible to not match at all about 23 of students dont match to anything
and if that happens it is looked down upon and it is much harder to match in the future its possible and in neurology the match rate is only 70
so i might be forced to do another specialty
i aint the best student anymore everyone in medical school is a fucking beast
thats true but i scraped by
shit son thats not easy i think it will come down to luck and even if i match i could end up in a city that sucks and have no chinese waifu for another 5 years
man thats a long time away i got a real thirst you telling me you dont have a thirst
lmao i got absolutely none
im at the gym right now boy baby steps
lmao but i thought pythons were big arms
lmao whatever son you wanna play some dota
lmaoooo no i just wanna take a break i am burning out of this shit
we start the day typically 730 or 8am and we would end between 5 and 7pm
i think the exhaustion comes from the fact that we always gotta be on it is like the military
when your supervisor is in the room you stand with a straight back monday to frida y but in some weeks we are on call so we have some 24 hour shifts
which could include the weekend it is not the hardest i have worked in my life but it is quite tiring and i cant explain that part
some days i do not but some days i do
lmaoooo yo if you do i got nothing to say except that i salute you what do you plan to study
lmaooo no son i am getting dumber day by day
i feel that my mind works slower my memory is shit
ya everyone answers questions very fast they react very fast compared to me i still think i have good critical thinking skills
but in terms of my knowledge it is definitely shit ya i think thats true i need to increase my game in studying but it is very hard
no because i did not strive to be the best i gave up on that since i was in msc dude like i was extremely surprised how much i learned out of those 2 years
get what shit back
i cant frank it is long gone
it is fucking gg lemme put it this way in the past i think i was motivated by 2 things and i accept that fact
no i think that part is clear to me but i think we have different views of life
life is not about achieving a set number of career goals or becoming the best in my field that will never be me i have tremendous respect for those who are
i am playing an rpg yall boys are playing an rts
but frank i thank you for trying to motivate me you are a good friend for doing that and for listening to my reasoning
and i salute you for continuing to work hard in your life even if you have taken an unconventional or windy path
as long as you arent gambling your entire career i think its important to have a safety plan that can sustain you if things dont go well
yo if you make it big i hope we can celebrate like big ballers one day
you have great confidence i cant guarantee it but i am hoping for it
thats important for mental health but i dont think it can affect outcomes too much
ok
i will likely not play this weekend my dad wants me to go home to celebrate some birthdays and he is back from china so i gotta see him
lmao he is not a legend he is just a man
lol that is what i heard too politics man that is some mad shit
later
lmao boy you are too tame that is hardly a side boob
lmao i dont got anything better but that is hardly a boob i seen many pictures of boobs and that aint special
that is some creepy shit actually you are taking pics of girls without them knowing
lmao i am not sure what the legal status is just be careful
you ninja
lool yo man tell me more about your japan life i am real curious i love to travel and see what things are like in other places
the sights as in the girls or the nature landscape or the city
lmao well they say asian women dont age much that might be why they are so sought over but ya realistically there aint nothing you can tell me about the girls i wanna hear about the daily life
is that a place they arranged for you canadians
lol ya it is the opposite in my education we can come up with suggestions but they are really a way of testing our knowledge and practicing making independent choices
ya there is a real answer when it comes to medications and shit and disease process but when it comes to how to talk to the patient that is more artistic
nah i am alright yo have you ever conisdered that your supervisors soft approach might just be cultural
and he is really trying to be nice about correcting you
ok what do you cook and where do you buy groceries i thought you told me food is so cheap in japan that you can just eat out every day
ya that is pretty darn cheap
shit son you are a master chef
god dam yo in 2020 maybe japan is the destination if you are still into it
btw did you see this httpswwwredditcomrvideoscommentsahfhgttryingtoguessanimecharactersages you might appreciate it
oh i see well i am an outsider to anime
i only have a taste from years ago when you recommended some things to me i think i know the tropes and memes but dont know much else
nah i am out for now actually we can chat another day
not sure about that one they already have big databases with certain types of data for certain diseases and be willing to come back
a business no way man it is usually shared for free
they upload it to their site and then researchers apply to access the data thats the way i have seen it
ok im not sure what i can tell you this is not my area of skill
im going to play badminton now
it is not a scene in the books because neither character is a point of view character but it is in character for these guys to chat like this it aint ridiculous at all and its a real scene
no he is not wearing a t shirt that is plausible clothing for middle ages tech
he might have been over exaggerating a little i will admit
and those 2 characters are some of the big intelligence players in kings landing they know about each others ways so there is no point playing around that in a private setting yo the scene is not a joke
tywin is the head of the richest house in the story he has fitted clothes custom made they didnt buy shirts in stores in those days
his son has some fancy ass armour and a priceless sword
he hates his other son tyrion but he still has access to his houses money so he can buy whatever he wants
well honestly it sounds like you found a scene and you are critiquing it to death even though i a huge fan of the series am seriously telling you it is a serious scene
in fact lemme tell you that i knew about this scene before you sent it to me part of the reason it was done is that the actor who plays pycelle is a very renowned actor in england but he often had to play a simple one dimensional role
i forgot where i got the info but i think it was an interview he gave
youre free to have that opinion i can agree maybe it was a bit overdone and i would even admit that maybe he overdid it a bit for some slight comedic effect thats my opinion
man all the actors in got are fucking fantastic the only bad ones are like shae and some dornish characters who you might not have met yet
lmao what
i think she was a horrible actress l m a o ooooooooo
100 destruction dude
damn dude well i guess she has 1 fan grrm is also a big fan of hers but idk why honestly she used to be an actual porn star
i am pretty sure she speaks the same way on the show that she speaks irl her background is turkish and german
l m a oooooooooo maybe man i dont really feel that shae is a legit deep character she is mainly there to add depth to tyrion
lol god damn you will be burning bridges there you are basically calling her a whore you sure thats a good idea
man if youre finding it happens to you a lot maybe you might be able to change that
dang dude countless
are you like trying to hit on all of them
i think a friend request is pretty innocent after you meet someone new im sorry that this shit happened to you man it is insulting i agree
thats unfortunate man i cant tell you i understand what to do
lmao
you a fan now
im glad you like it son
why
lmao how old is pulp fiction
oh ok maybe he was lol it is symbolic top
lmao you are not a literary critic
damn frank well spotted he is a pro gamer
listen to this my friend httpswwwredditcomrvideoscommentsakos54letthewhitekidssaynigga
i think it would make you happy to know that some black people believe you can say it cuz you are saying it anyway
god damn meng bao is looking like a hot k pop star
the hell is that
its a very complex tooic topic
why du you ask
interesting conference are you presenting
lmao nice well just make something up to answer that question
ok well in my opinion that was a very dumb thing to do because the conference obviously believes its important if they asked you about it i think its important but its hard to address objectively
thats good stuff man i didnt know you were interested in brains
im set on neurology its my dream and if i fail i will try to family med
thanks son how did you like it
lmao what the hell cersei is crazy who are your favorites
lmao son all people can become like that its not just your mother
lmao maybe cuz you know more chinese women than other women
lmao shes a minor character but loved by fans for her loyalty im a fan of jaime and stannis
he aint dead in the books and they ruined his character on the show
in the books he is stone cold badass
yeah man for sure one day you can read them again when the whole series is done if that day ever comes
damn shame the finest stories i know are from books
so how was it  did you ace it
how were the questions  like any tricks or stuff to watch out from
what was the hardest question
i studied a lot for this simple quiz  im nervous af about it ð
its not that i know literally everything  i even have a quiz from last year  but i just cant help but to feel nervous even if it is just a 15
how do you mean
i wish i knew maybe i studied too much
i think its the pressure to succeed then
how do i eliminate them
wow thats some solid advice man thanks ð haha u sure have a lot of experience
it was good did you get the yellow paper or the white one
i had yellow
alright  ill see you around mate

he sent one ð
you can ask
i know a bit
i never attended one
they showed us how in the elg lab we worked with capacitors resistors and inductors
and i personally worked on a transistor yes
maybe u could use the soldering table in makerspace it looks engineerish
i recon u can find their times online
mohammed ó° mohammed sent some attachments
taddaaa went with professor franks advice what do u think mohammed sent an attachment
oui
its because youre a good teacherð thanks a lot for helping me

that you actually did some work on it even after its due
hahaha no no frank i always have faith in your production abilities i thought it was due last wednessday  and good job with the camera movments and the dialogs that show u how do cam control
not at the moment but im in the process of swapping my classes around i may want to sit in on that class though
i wonder how it differs from new venture creation in telfer
ideation business modeling and validation the business planning process including market evaluation and the marketing plan physical human resources and organizational planning and the financial plan student projects in moving an actual business concept through the process from idea to plan including crafting a business idea building a business model implementing a validation plan and writing a business plan
what ever you want but i think youre assigned a team so ill ask some ppl who took it just to be sure tho
awesome
yea he sent me the link
sounds good im doing just to get more experience  skill drafting business plans
so where is the new place you want to take the idea p
ohhhh like literally
ok ok i was a bit confused before now that exams are finally over i finally have the time to look into game design again
im gonna be spending lots of time in unity this break but ive been looking at the market a lot and ive identified some possible projects that could help us develop our skills
well i was thinking of creating small games that we can integrate into the browser to rapidly prototype them and get lots of data from
yea i really think we need to hone our skills before we scope on anything large we should build our development philosophy by working on multiple smaller projects and really focus on getting tons of feed back
yea big time ive been looking at a few simple games like agario  wildsio and slitherio that type of game has a monetization scheme that supports small scope projects httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistplhykya0yj5c6qc36h5eapoyxtx98ehgi also that channel is a gold mine of info
kk talk to you later ill let you know  ill be on a greyhound all day so ill be on messenger
funny you ask im actually doing that right now
will do also  my laptop  home broke so i cant use unity d im learning a web based game engine since i only have my chrome book atm
just aweful have you heard of phaserio
yup its pretty intuitive  it works on a cloud ide so
yea that would be great and web is really good for rapid prototyping hows your game coming along
ill help with the level design fo sho
ill also talk to a guy who wants to write for games im not sure what the quality will be but hes pretty creative im practicing sprite art but im god aweful
it he works at a space company in the usa now him and i have always spoken about making games but we never really get past the idea part
ill need to ask him we havent spoken in a while
kk cool have you given any more thought to forming a studio  entity and i assume you got julians email also
jobbbs
yea unless i get into valve
but yea im on the same page in terms of jobs and yea i heard about how they saw the students prototype and then took them on board have you read their employee manual
its really cool and their company structure is a work of art everyones equal and free to work on what they want
its beautiful
yea big time how their company is structured is the gold standard imo httpwwwvalvesoftwarecomcompanyvalvehandbooklowrespdf
imagine if zynga stole a project of yours turned it into a f2p monstosity monstrosity
kk im almost done the level image
kk in the meantime brainstorm some studio name ideas
damn i like that i can already see the slash screen
splash
branding
makes perfect sense i say we roll with that name for the time being i really like it
yea for sure we are but its food for thought imo first things first is the games
httpsdocsgooglecompresentationd1zaflepi0q9oxjswvzwonus8qov5hut9zc5fdrrtzx5eedituspsharing i made some minor changes
made it less cramped and worked in the whole multiple rooms at once thing
yea im annotating each of the mechanics rn
hardly work iz fun kk i added annotation and further simplified do you think its clear enough
they serve the same purpose as the ones on the right hand side both need to be pressed to drop the wall thing
the human has to cross to solve the puzzel puzzle so he can pull the lever and allow the bird to fly over
ah i forgot about that i was looking at my paper drawing as reference ill pull up what i have on my phone
ttyl
hey  what section of gng4120 are you in
ah i see i wont be able to take it then
very nice have you ever heard of the website httpwwwgamasutracom
ah its a pretty good resource lots industry information
only for specific reasons ive been looking up how the gaming industry  investors and finances work lately
yea you bet  they also have some constructive stuff to procrastinate on
ive noticed that in the usa the game industry is akin to their music industry
hahah useful article first you need to learn french second you go to uozone and  go to applications then cmd f grades
yup
nada same old lmao i usually get them in the new year
i think the french courses grades come out quick tho
besides the basics no what kind of job are you looking for
ill look around to see if i can help you
im also entrepreneurial whatever that means so sometimes for cash i try to make custom solutions for business if an opportunity comes up that you may succeed in ill fill you in
not it perse but i have vouches from a few businesses  know some guys
hahah not really most of the ppl that ive worked with have all been via the computer
hahah yea
can u link it
i can help you out my man
just the socialising part
forming the team eventually tho
no doubt yea we should crash some bar nights telfer has taught me a thing or two
hahah yea like i met like 6 comm majors in 1 night because they were having some event  and i went there and got 2 beer most telfer kids too im in accounting so i gotta pretend to work
i really doubt it
a bit of both most ppl are here to study history and theory of it
instead they develop bad habbits and  go into debt some become scholars yea i like the arts but full time study of it is yikes
ya ya finished hs in waterloo tho
we did then we moved to waterloo my grades were bad and my brother was being a dink but i grew up in toronto i left in like grade 11
yea most of my immediate family does also
not planning on coming back here after school though not unless im desolate and jobless
yea max out the team and see the constraints very good idea game jams seem fun
yea we should do it alot
i honestly think we should start a page or a blog or something really small and separable from ourselves then dump ip  and game jam experience  ideas etc and when money becomes a thing we have the company discussion
id only do it from a capitalist pov those things are only good if i wanna be taking as many dollar bills as i possibly can thats what a startup is essentially growth
point of view
lmao
yup like my grandpa and aunt are accountants so its in my dna hahaha so in spending tons of hours learning accounting ive developed a kind of jaded outlook on money
i agree i honestly treat it like a trade its not fun but ppl need it done i am developing the skill set and if i need to eat i can use it
one fallacy that like 80 of ppl have is that money is the ultimate goal and studying accounting you quickly realise that money alone is pretty useless
in a sense the only thing an individual can do with cash is really fold it and burn it value  money
an asset on the books isnt valuable because how much it cost or brings in its value is its contribution to the operation of the biz yup exactly
sounds good im gonna parse gamasutra and the web  and try to think up some possible business models in the industry ttyl
what u think about this httpsdrivegooglecomfiled0b63ecaqbv8dvuzh4ngf0qwhha0uviewpageid109767914012379959622
some guys theory on how to bridge indie and aaa httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwskcxc9ova goes with that vid
yea if i had to guess i would say its because indies dont wanna give up ip and publishers dont know where to start happy new year httpsocwmiteducoursescomparativemediastudieswritingcms611jcreatingvideogamesfall2014
man im really tired of phaser i cant wait to get back to unity
yea i liked it before using phaser but after this i love it  unity can do browser games
yea its really robust im committing to it for game development i gotta learn some c
yea i gotta wait till i get back to ottawa to use it cuz ma laptop broke in the mean time im learning some c
im not only telfer classes next sem for me
im doing the harvard cs50 class online and they use c
im gonna be teaching myself alot so i figure knowing c will help
yea i think most languages get translated into c before they get compiled into assembly hey what times are your iti1120 lectures
ty
nice im gonna sit in on some classes if you dont mind when you get the syllabus could you send it to me
yea 1121
ty ty hows the game coming along
hahah deadlines really work wonders what is this thing you speak of
canadian university software engineering conference
nice  seems pretty cool a good networking opportunity also
hopefully after you demo some like minded people will approach you
not that many people at the conference in general
ah yes i agreei suspect the majority of educators will meet us and this idea with adversity we have quite the mission ahead of us
good plan conferences and events are so key for finding jobs i went to a telfer event spoke to 2 ppl and got 2 interviews
btw i abandoned c for c i figure its most logical to focus on the language unity uses also do you want me to start looking into basic press stuff for your game
yea i meant mainly market  distribution and competition research if you had to give a rough estimate on the completion of the game what would you say its at
i see what do you think is holding you back the most
ah i see workflow of a 1 man team seems really challenging have you ever considered using game maker
bad time investment you figure
game makers pretty flexible for 2d games its arguably better than unity of course it has no 3d support httpwwwyoyogamescomshowcase lots of great games have been made there im not sure how much programing  flexibility it allows for though
yea i think that unity is going to become the industry standard especially for indies some of my favorite games have been made in both engines
yea i still intend on making unity my primary engine learning it makes me a better programmer its more flexible and more powerful i just see the simplicity of game maker as convenient but harmful in the long run
ok enjoy and no worries well have time to coordinate our efforts when we can meet up again
pce
httpwwwgamasutracomviewnews2883437educationalgamesthateverydevelopershouldstudyphp
ill check it out
this is pretty cool this could be the future of education give people lab exprince for a low cost and no risk experince  experience
yea its very immersive
i know developing for vr is so dificult though man i cant spell today
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcwvd9gzdyuu
hahah well we wont be first movers but this affirms the vision also think of how ar could add to learning and the peleothora of applications of this idea
i was brainstorming with a friend about putting a spin on paintball and ar basically customize a venue and make an ar game that simulates a zombie survival scenario
that buys us some time
california state university harvard gwinnett technical college mit exeter university university of new haven stanford university of new england trinity college university of hong kong and berkeley to name a few
afik this is all done in c and unity
as far as i know
yea which is good news for us
yea i got bored real quick and clicking cant fully simulate working in that environment
so rather than reading about what youre going to do you go on this click adventure and  learn about the lab with real life context
for labster i think their goal is to add to the classroom learning environment by giving students context to what they learn and giving them live feed back although its hard to say from my limited look at it
i think that using games and interaction in general  helps the student build the big picture for themselves
where traditional methods like textbooks classrooms and profs help put the information into your head but dont really give you the context necessary to master the subject yea labster is a little peak into the future of education
an example of what i was saying with gamification vs the class room is say i study  marketing for 4 years get straight as and legit  know every marketing concept there is im less attractive to employers than someone with experince because although i have the knowledge i dont have the experience of marrying those concepts together in an interactivereal environment
strategy problems moving resource management planning etc
and others like risk management team coordination etc im not sure if we should focus on gamifying specific curriculums or creating games that do more for a person than give them some fun distraction
or a game like space engineers
exactly  games can give you the soft skills required to learn specific disciplines
i heard from most mentors during startup weekend that most gamers have to be tricked into learning with some subjects thats a monumental task others it trivial yo yo
ah i dont think its unbusiness like furthermore im not to worried about business at the moment i think the main thing for us to do now is get good at making games and in order to do that we need to make games that interest us
plus i think that game is a great idea and the biology part fits into the game perfectly
hahaha like that games narrative is cell biology
i mean they very well could but ill admit my arrogance here i really believe as ill fated as it may be that we can be some of the best game makers of all time
hahah were both arrogant about that then which is good  thats one less point we wont clash on
yea no doubt any successful game dev that though that but im making that my personal conviction im not gonna be satisfied until i think we devlop some of the best games
yea thats the scary part but i can sincerely say that even if i work a 95  in a job i love im not gonna stop thinking about games
exactly games have been my medium of choice since before i could read man
yea man if you didnt pitch i would have drank that weekend away with my compadres hahaha i came there with 2 guys and they both left and i was like fuck it up untill you pitched ahjhhaha
ye son
how old r u again
ye ye 21 weve been over this before but  i still like the business world but its not something im passionate about  its just to make a living until i can do what i want
yea some most people really want to lock themselves into a career as early as possible like some of my peers already have b4 offers and are basically signing a decade of thier life away before they even graduate
yea most people dont have that 1960s mindest
i mean more people are going to fail but ontop of that more people are going to succeed banks will help me with business sense and programming
uh 1 sec ill try to pull it up for ya also do you need any design help with that game
tmw or sunday
i think residence fees should be under the account summary application on uozone im not sure though since its all changed around from 23 years ago
im not too sure since they changed all the stuff before this year we had to go on an entirely different website to pay and check grades
but the fee should be for living expensesand the association cost is to pay for ras and the other dumb shit
glad we share the enthusiasm pce out a town
back in ottawa
you know unity is partner with nintendo on the switch and gladly
ill read about and do some puzzles in the mean time
interesting
my schedule is pretty straight forward this semester  ill be available tuesday during the day for a couple hours
that sounds good httpwwwceebotcomceebotteenteenephp thoughts on competition 1015 year olds german
f4f f4t im just fucking with you food for though hahah
sounds good ill google magnets and launch unity finally back how goes the coding
good to hear about gng it gives us limits so we can audit our performance and design methods also when is your talk
yea a lot of people dont realize speaking in public is an skill and that you need to practice if you ever need a good book about public speaking i know a couple great ones
no worries also we should try meticulous in our design process and try to collect data that we can turn into information try to be lol hey i just watched the switch press conference im gonna buy one
yea
hypefest
need a new laptop too so that comes first but thatll be my next console
nice how did it go
great validation is really useful do you have the slides you presented
oh damn even better hmm do you have drop box
sure man its too early to say but the switch is gonna suit some of our needs bigtime im really glad its coming out
oh nice it concentrates our market onto a platform and they have a huge focus on 2 player
np
console ships with 2 controllers and the controllers are really functional
no we still have a ways to go before developing a console release pc is enough for now but if we ever focus on the  home gamer i think well reach them by the switch
no problemo do you have your iti syllabus
i cant run the exe without the data folders
nope and i dont have permission to view the page
ok sounds good ty for the syllabus
ah this syllabus doesnt have the class schedule
ty enjoy your buzz ciderman how was ces
yea cusec
damn right we will
yea im not to sure i get what they mean by science fiction
hmm i guess they have a narrow view of education btw  i may sound like a dick saying this but im not too sure how saif will fit into all of this
very true anyway im off to bed well talk about this more l8r i saw the video it looks pretty cool good job sofar
right i figured that was what you had theres a lot of work to do before investors including polish of course  the big thing is that progress is being made and even with what ive seen in that video i can think of a ton of game mechanic applications inside and outside of this game
like ive been drafting up random game ideas and what you have could be the basic engine for atleast 3 games that ive thought up
yup so were meeting up tmw at noon
im pretty sure
fss
and and a random question is the code you have for that game object oriented
ok then yea its object oriented but are you sticking to strict style  function formatting protocol
consistent would be a better way to say it
ok comments are whatever at this point but as long as its readable im happy just because id like to be able to re use as much code as possible game to game
kk nice i know the basics of oop
kk nice class time ttyl
i havent added anything to it i cant seem to remember what i thought up for the top part how was the club meeting
right like all the animals
 right right
i like that better tbh
sounds good
transformation is a lot easier to manage
nice is there a gdoc or somthing something
kk no worries any new ppl
sweet  ofcourse this entire week im gonna put my nose down and try to get ahead before it piles up beyond belief luckily most of my stuff is simple
well before midterms most of my classes are simple just simple tax rules a couple presentations and basic finance concepts most telfer classes get difficult because how much you need to know
same ttyl dog
pce httpiimgurcomdnqn2zagifv random
hahah yea
maybe what time
i got class
yea let me know how it goes is there a page for this event
oh ofcourse
i see it
i can help with that
sounds good hey  is there a meeting tmw
right have you ever thought of modding games
indeed whatever projects we do we need to have short term goals but we can still develop the idea of the game we have i think we should kind of structure the studio like a gameplay lab
yea a studio needs alot of energy i guess i studio is the wrong name for what im thinking of working on im gonna focus on mechanics and game jams
yea rn im working on getting some basic mechanics into a game and getting feedback on a dew design choices a few in terms of a studio one is usless unless were shipping a product
will do im actually thinking of modifying the magnetism system you have for an idea of mine
nice ill make an example of what i want to be consistently be creating over the next couple weeks when im done let me know if youd be willing to program for any projects like it in the future
also i just did a little contract and mined a bunch of data about gamers do you know anything about pandas or matplotlib
can you recommend any good unity tuts
right its a simple example but covers the basics i see what you mean
yea i did a couple other tutorials  and they just showcased one specific function feature of unity
makes sense im gonna do the roguelike after this one
o shiiiiit so is it biweekly starting this weekend
ah i thought the meeting was nextweekend any luck in your job search frank
httpsjobsrbccomgostudentsandnewgraduates585700 hopefully that helps banks are usually always looking for fresh meat not many  great postings in ottawa mind you
lots of new grads taking the spots but that rbc board is updated constantly so i always keep an eye out yo ea is having a talk on campus this wednesday the 8th
nice same here did you register yet
is there a club meeting this sat
right right next sat then
kk nice i hope i didnt miss too much
advocation is a pain but very needed
good point the people who keep coming back are the ones who care about the topic ill be there since my midterms are prett ymuch over
 ux is exactly what i want to do the programming is just a means httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmpd5dubfsps
yea its great advice
yup and using that approach is super efficient you wont invest tons of time on one large shitty project youll instead make a ton of small shitty projects that will eventually scale into somthing great  get feedback on
ok a very basic one is a puzzlestrategy game it will play out on a hex map and be turn based the player is a tribe that has a food suply  no food  game over
yup
but if we itterate i could see it turning into  rts or even action yup survive and tech up httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvv7kzwowhjc kinda like this i had the idea before thishoplite game but that game gave me a bit of direction
kinda no action game ideas off the top but i could think
i agree
ok im gonna go for a walk and ill nodoubt get atleast 10 ideas brbr
multiplayer isnt a possibility  at the moment right
ive thought up a simple core loop we can test  player has a goal  a hard time limit to satisfy the goal  player has to use the core mechanic meeting the goal increases ability
i think that loop can lend itself to lots of mechanics do you have any in mind
thats good to hear i dont have that at the moment i lack the technical experience to get a clear idea of a full game explaining an image is difficult especially over fb but could you try to give me an idea of the type of game
i think ive seen that tutorial thats a good game idea is it this httpprntscrcomebr7fh
kk i like this idea and im going to think about it more i think i know a way we can make it unique and fun until next time
i have a few cube mechanics in mind for puzzle games its best to design by iteration  testing
basic mechanic would be you are in first person and need to get from point a to b
yea i had that idea also stack the blocks to work your way up and then introduce cubes that react to eachother in a specific way
np np lets meet up this week  or somthing
just let me know when youre free a 1520 minute meeting is more effective than an hour fb chat imo
get back 2 ur assignment
kk ill see if i can make it i have an exam on sunday morning i have some concepts for that cube game idea this sat is the club meeting
tt nooooooo
i see i see are we still working on thatr platformer
will there be another meeting this coming sat
kk cool ill be there
at what time
ah i have clas 53010 rip i may skip whats the workshops content
ok  i may go to my class late then
yea ill see that my lectures are about then decide from there meeting is next sat rigth
hahaha actually were you at a table and no i didnt im on floor 3 now
oh i have a table if you wanna join
kk if you come down im  close to site side not in the big table lobby
kk cool 2pm
kk cool running a little late heading over now
yo yo things  are good man how are you also im playing around with firstperson and third person mechanics
sounds good i dont have much time but ill give you some details when i get in
any specific part ill look through my notes
ok ill put something together for you as for first and third person im playing around with making a scene that the player can switch from 1st to 3rd person
no no im learning to do that as kind of a cap stone
well right now im learning the first person mechanics then ill learn the thirdperson stuff and see if i can marry them
yup
thats good news
i see and if i wanted a third camera like an rts camera
awesome im gonna get back to studying for now but ill send you some concepts from the block idea we had
also im thinking of working on an idle  strategy  text  game during the summer also ttyl
hey frank been really busy with exams but ill try to get that block idea to ya soon
ty ty this is actually one of my worst exam seasons but itll be over soon hows everything with you
thats good to hear
awesome congrats
ah the one where you have to finish a product
right right was she on your team
thats really good to hear im happy for you
i bet that did some common ground to start off with
fairly well just focused on securing a sublet and a place for next year also doing some basic reading into net code and multiplayer interaction in unity
hahahah right i just cant wait to be free from class and be able to focus my efforts on game development
i feel like i have so many great little ideas and i cant act on them or vet any out until i get to coding it
yup i may be workign odd jobs since i havent had much luck so ill have lots of time to code this summer
yes yes indeed thats gonna be my main job this sumemr infact right after i finish my last exam although game genres can be in accurate im looking alot into simulation aspects in games
thats a great jump off point thanks frank
if i can get myself a weekly challenge ill be able to commit to it over the summer and thinking up a challenge per week wont be too hard
yea theres alot and they are all very interesting
i did codewars over the winter break
ill look at hacker rank also my goal by the end of the summer is to git gud at coding
and gamification would help so much yo yo
good advice nice talking to you also enjoy your dinner and congrats on your girl
sup frank
anthony sent an attachment anthony sent an attachment
oh shit ill try to send again ill email them to you
np np  whats your email again
kk i sent it i downloaded the photos too so i can fb them to you if need be
no prob ill send them here also jsut cuz anthony sent a photo anthony sent a photo
aw shit my phone camera is pretty ass
kk  well basically the gameworld each level is inside a box or a cube where the walls ceiling and floor are made out of a simple grid
each cell in the grid has a certain heightlength  the player can use energy to change the length of certain cells
im gonna start coding this tn and very nice what do you do there
sounds good very interesting job see ya
hey man work has been very hectic but now that its calming down im getting back into it
yes 60h a week ive been looking at a bunch of game design stuff and like tabletop games
i got 2 jobs trying to be a rich man hahahah i put my self through it knowing it will all be done in sept how about you whats new
ay thats realy good to hear im glad youre enjoying your job
vnice
hey man ive been working like a dog havent gotten a chance to do any game dev that being said id love to contribute to what you have id like to get involved and help with what i can
im back in ottawa wednesday maybe we can meet up at some point
the game sounds intriguing
that sounds like a great idea we should definitely develop this the poltergeist idea is really refreshing too
can you text me actually im low on data 2269728696
hey man  im back in ottawa httpstrellocominvitebhzaluois61c25537a4c566670ecb6c5c0a73881cgamedevelopmentroadmap this is what i was gonna send you that ne night srry about it being way way late lol
its a simple organization platform this way we can coordinate development without wasting time to meet unnecessarily
it could be useful if we use it right hey dude  ill be done midterms today so i will be able to work on game development restarted my unity tutorials
ah i see i may just work on some other game ideas if thats the case
ah very nice and yes learning is indeed the most important thing imo especially right now
hopefully the game youre working on goes well
ah i see what you mean a means to an end thats what these toy games im working on are just simple ideas that can be stated and finished
yup that one
i need two more electives so im thinking of taking its perquisite and then taking it
intro to computing 2 the java course
no ok
i think so
right those are more focused in learning to code right
thanks for that im not looking for theory necessarily more applications also  i started level design with revit i made a scale version of my flat do you know how to move that into unity
ah ok its really powerful for level design similar to cad if  i figure out a way to get the 3d model into unity ill show it to you
ok thats good to know ty for the info about the classes saved me a lot of time
hows the course work going youre in software now right
i find studying theory without applications to be the hardest thing its not difficult but like you said so easy to get distracted
they are taking forever to upload
anthony sent a video anthony sent a video anthony sent a video
the door glitch only happened sometimes i csnt make it happen again but it did that multiple times
i cant reproduce it now for some reasons also the front door behaves oddly when in contact with the boxes near it
ok
ok that seems like a great introduction for the basic mechanic
in that case why would the player move the doll in the first place would the objective be  finish moving in by throwing away all the old junk
thats a good idea
indeed they will just seem like random tasks now story wise you want the doll to be left in the house and the issues
the only challenge i see with that idea is that there is no clear indication for the player that the doll belongs on the desk
yes thats what i was going to say
right so the first level the only ghost item will be the doll as to introduce the player to the mechanics
maybe we can take the first level really slow and have it function somewhat different from the rest of the levels we  would have the players objective be just to finish unpacking they would come into their new apartment with the box notice that the doll is in the apartment and as they unpack have the doll change positions
that would show them that when they take their eyes away from a possessed item that it gets moved around and it would be creepy also
that would kind of function as level 0 since there is no puzzle element
good idea its an interesting art form and has unique challenges
yup hence the name poltergeist
i remember you telling me that when you had the first demo
plus if we tried to hard to be scary it would just be corny
and some of them are impossible to compete with
not really no i will have to learn this i know some of the basics brb i need to head to campus
ok great i already have a bunch of ideas with some context i will probably start on it tmw as after this 710  i will be tiredd
time constraints are good keeps it focused japan for coop eh that sounds awesome
they make the best media thats forsure
my friend got me hooked on anime lol
i watched some of  here and ther but this passed summer mainly i finished black lagoon and now just watch anime bedfore bed everyday coop in japan would be awesome
it was insane now im watching death note and full metal alchemest
ok man take care ttyl
will not have much time until this weekend
ofcourse fridays are my busiest days so i have lots of work to do thursday  friday
pretty good frank i have a few concepts im working on in the existing level im trying to figure out how to best lay out items for a certain effect wby
sounds good man
i have two gameplay mechanic ideas to bounce off you first items disappearing after not being in your gaze for a set time interval and second items disappearing only if they are i the view of a another object
for example the dool doll could that work by putting a camera like the players in the doll
i was thinking the latter but both could be interesting
that could lead to very interesting puzzles in my opinion
good idea i will get those done
yeah honestly all i have done is play with the item placement and see if there are any rules or fundamentals atleast
some can always sneak by it seems
ok ill delay any technical work thinking about the gsme is refreshing i  enjoy the creative side so i just generate a bunch of ideas or content ill
yeah man no rush school is a lot of work also frank from your experince with game development what would you rank the difficulty of a project like this  httpstoresteampoweredcomapp416070mars2030 in terms of code and unity work
i see thanks i am just looking at games that seem simple in concept but are refined
ok will do
ok man im doing some of that for a class too
yes its one of the techniques we use in business data mining
haha no worries good to hear the mission system is in machine learning is great lots of fun imo
nice what features did you implement
hahah oh my god
sweet
very nice after this week im pretty much free free
those seem like great features be right back yo have you added the mission functionality into the bit bucket also ive been thinking of some simple coop multiplayer game could you help me lay out the codebase
sounds good
very nice what was the hackathon about
damn that sounds sweet what tools did you use to achieve this
do you know if that apis uses supervised or unsupervised models im also curious how that game you insight on poltergeist
ill have to look at that api and i meant gave not game
i like to go for walks for that
i understand
some parks can be good a certain times the winter doesnt help now that items can be toggled possessed  there will be more variables for level and gameplay design
thats alright
great i have been thinking of a few coherent themes for the collection of levels to include 1 new corporate job 2 scientistengineer 3 immigrant worker by corporate i mean professional  lawyer  doctor whaterver
we can play on being funny and not horror   with this i feel
ah very intersting idea
i feel like the professional theme would complement that idea well
detached selfconscious professional is so desperately trying to move up the ladder that an  ancient horror isnt the top of his priorities even if it makes his domestic life chaos hahaha
yes if deathnote can be funny this can
lmao a random idea came to me
i have had the assumption the entire time that this game is in a modern setting just to brainstorm what if we assumed that the game took place in a few odd settings
i know that you have put lots of good work into the current modern settingi remember you mentioning you are working towards photorealism but just to simplify that brain dump what if this game took place on a boat
perhaps a boat like the american mayflower its very limiting and could be perhaps frustrating to players this is just a random idea mind you
what if it was a warboat like a big ww2 aircraft carrier type deal sailors
i am starting to be inspired a little by this game here is just a short clip httpsyoutube6xonexe5iimt176 for now we should not worry about theme when we design levels purely functionality and player enjoyment
ok ill be studying tomorrow so during breaks i will likey check facebook
have a good one
you gonna be here for the summer man
thats good i remember you mentioning japan im alright i have a 4 telfer group projects and in 3 of them the group depends on me 100 and in teh other about 35 i will also be here
ill need it hahah
grind away that sounds like quite the challenge after these projects im going to going work on my developments skills
yes wli am excited to get these school projects done and work on the flgame i am going to try to learn how to implement other simple functionality in unity myself
i have done a couple the platformer and the rogue like since i am very interested in making roguelikes
oh
just finishing up the intopia weekend you cracked the code eh awesome bro
o mg
thats frustrating god damn
awesome thats great news im glad that we can move forwards i will try to get some ideas in writting and make them actionable for you and i
yes and now that my biggest group project is out of the way i can use the time on this doing a project i actually enjoy
no kidding id like to ship this game as our first im very excited we should meet up some time
ill let you know asap ill get them down so we cant talk about them specifically and make them into actions can
ttyl dude just wrapping this up and will be heading home
thats not bad we can work on one mirror levels until its implemented
it might be a good idea to start the player off with just one mirror too making the player able to interact with the environment csn add alot of complexity
hey man wanna see if we can plan the earliest we can meet up
lets meet this weekend then
i may be at legacy conference at that time ill letyou know
would you be interested on n attending that its about 60
after 6 il one available on saturday the conference ends at 5
sounds good man lets meet saturday at diner
school caf is good cuz we can talk and snack at the same time its close cheap and has wifi
yes im down wanna go somewhere nicer
just broke up with my gf haha so anywhere with wifi and drinks
ah well thank you but its not needed  its for the best i move on fast lol
i know father and sons could be a choice i doubt it will be busy before 6 not until 9
yeah its right next door
great see you then
join my trello board httpstrellocominvitebxtvt4lwf1ae4b978c07b2bcf729b2ddb88c041e0poltergeist
no worries i dont have mustapha on facebook but we should add him in
i havent gotten a chance to set everything up yet ill be doing some at around noon for now feel free to use anything
great i am just touching up an assignment for 10am as we speak my musician friends showed a lot of interest also
hey do you have ugamify on your resume
i just put it on two of my friends helped me make some resumes would you be able to give me some feedback if you have the chance
woot ok i have two anthony sent some attachments i dont know which is better i dont have coop or any real work experince so i have to push it a little lol
thanks for the feed back im still working on it so its ok hey man just doing an assignment then ill post up some designed levels
any animes you would reccomend
i like them on in the background while i work
ill take that risk hahaha hey just submitting my last assignment today then i will beable to focus on the game
great hey i have two basic levels designed now i just need to implement them i want to get feeback on them before i continue i also have a small prolougetutorial designed
ok great i will put it in slack the dimensions of the level will affect the puzzle so we may need to experiment hey man will be in waterloo for the summer any word from mostapha
do you think its likely he will contribute to the project
yes indeed i ask because i would like to conduct user testing on some simple level layouts to see how people behave in our rooms
a stable release that we can distribute in my understanding our bottleneck is programming work to stomp bugs
i will just need a rundown of the mission mechanics in unity but yes the current state of the game is great for my aims
ill try to collect 1520 indivudual user reactions ok great i am commitment free from the 25th to the 2nd
ttyl good studying frank
anthony ó°
anthony ó°
hey did i miss it got in  late and discord is acting up yo when will you be in japan after i graduate i want to take a vacation there by myself
winter 2019 next semester wil lbs my last so if all gos to plan i will be i  japan in march or april
great if all goes to plan we should meet up
im starting to save now im not sure how much i will need
thanks for the info
some introductory course i think i dont recall taking a course on pure management
ah yes i recall that
ok accessing it how for marketing recruitment
ok let me brood on this for a bit and ill hit you back as for leading it would be as simple as being effective in using social media from my pov
i found that replacing the term leading with directing makes it more intuitive
so if your plan is to create a positive image through a social media campaign your directing  would be the means to that end brb
yup caps but in turn it has an effect the point is that once you control all your results you use that to plan then organize then lead again also i have a proposed layout anthony sent a photo
bottom left
just like how we have it now anthony sent a photo
it could realistically be on any wall in that quadrant
maybe a bookshelf or wall unit painting or somthing reflective even
yes or through the bathroom
im unclear of what you mean
yes
or through the entertainment space my picture didnt illustrate that well
anthony sent a photo as it is now i feel like there isnt enough space the room is too balanced as it is
yes
can you walk me through that process when you do it  have the chance
can we try 2030 bigger
indeed
30 is pushing it
fully yes i work around 95
ok  also i will need time in unity with the new mechanics
we should document too this week whats your schedule like
ok i will make time after dinner tomorrow to do this that should be around 7 is that ok for you
see you
take care hey man might be a bit later tonight i have to drive my pops
i have half of it ready basically all that is missing is the climax and the ending
acts 13 are for the most part written
yes i want to see how these play out first httpswwwevernotecomshards257sh5006540f86fc4d4e8d8b794c2ef8922a57ddfb134dfc1133e990714d6aafa0f4
i mean 3 acts could be enough
any feedback
the noise
the alarm clock beep beep beep
it was moved but he can still hear it thin walls
good to hear
good to hear
ok
i was thinking that he is traveling away from home attending meetings and working in his rental
was that your idea
my question is if we need to show these areas we could just show the player leaving the apt
i had an idea of a taxi getting the player
the three acts good ot hear
thanks for the feedback frank
theres a lot of things you can do i want to incorporate the bathroom
im eating in 10 minutes then i have to drive my grandpa if youre still willing to when i get back that would be nice but i cant say forsure how long i will take
gonna be really late so lets do it whenever you are free next
was sketching some environments and randomly thought of two design questions what if the player cant solve the puzzle and secondly will the player expect the mirrors to shatter
yes ill be free in about two hours
hey im ready whenever you are
skype
frank my man all is good in the hood 5 more days left in my undergrad woo how are u
lmao good in the hood is just a saying hahah levelling up on tech huh what are you working with
sweet  yeah i messed around with a few technologies and ended up making a classification network
i just wanted to see if i could actually apply the idea of machine learning in a way i could show to employers
thats wicked are you still in japan
nice and what about the hospital job congratz on that
nice nice dude youre gonna be so ahead in the job market lol the issues i could have worked out but i just didnât have the time available
will do  i have a great business idea from my job this past summer that requires machine learning
yeah exactly its just a classification problem at its core the issue i assume  is dealing with all the random human errors in the emails you still working with unity
right right makes sense for what youve got going
nothing 100 but i have some good prospects
yea i havenât really been looking just putting all my effort into finishing up
lmao thats very optomistic
im gonna try to get into a company that i really wanna contribute in which os a challenge
if school taught me any it is that although i still do desire to make games for profit i realized that i need to start with absolute baby steps
it really does for example i decided to do all the assignments for my simulation class in python i think im going to look at web based development next i feel comfortable enough in python to move on
i have started learning javascript a while ago but ive been off and on
theres a javascript game called screeps so ive been playing with that im going to try to translate some of my python scripts into javascript once exams are done
ð haha yeah i remember that time slowly but surely what kind of websites do you want to create
hmm very interesting so many ways you could solve that problem have you ever used nodejs
dude its pretty exciting i got this course on it a while ago when i was working on a web business idea
yeah its amazing what the internet enables its taken for granted too does you having a summer job mean that there arenât any existing medical imaging databases for clinicians
thats mindblowing to me
yeah  i actually covered something related to that in one of my courses imagine building deep learning into the database
thats excellent  theyre lucky they got you
i feel like there are alot of practical solutions that big institutions are just now adopting
that  but also things like online databases id think that a big challenge could be the security concerns i remember when a prof of mine was talking about ontario health care he mentioned that is a big factor
hey did you ever do more work on your study ai idea
yeah
lmao oh man i can relate
yeah it is a very audacious idea but have you coincidered reducing the scope
ahh i see what you mean hitting that threshold in an area that would make it valuable is a challenge
im silver lol
yeah has the ai they opened up been able to beat the best players yet
ahh i see your point i also think that if you applied that idea  to specific administrative jobs it would work since the rules of that game if you will arenât too confusing
yeah i havent played in a while but i think im going to try to so one of my web app ideas in the next coming months
yea thats the idea i want to take the time to really cement good work habbits and life skills in that time ive been looking forward to doing that without school hanging over my head for so long
pro life skills how are you enjoying japan whats your life like there in those couple of months im gonna challenge myself to make four  3 week long webapp projects
why is that just no interest to go on that type of expensive tour and which 2
nice why those regions and hey since thats the case youll be able to get a lot more enjoyment out of life
amazing  are you going north or south first getting a new perspective is a good part of travel but traveling on a greyhound is never enjoyable
ocr is optical character recognition  im gonna start up tensor flow tutorials again
well see what i can get done with javascript dude i am writing the last paper of my undergrad so im gonna head out for now talk to you soon my man
ty dude all done school hasnt even sunk in
lmao dude im thinking of taking classes but im not gonna jump into a full time degree fuck that i can learn myself
yea great idea im on udemy right now for javascriptnode
hate having to deal with bs professors man this one prof isnt accepting my final paper and it may really mess with my graduation
denied my digital copy and wont accept late submissions
even though i submitted digitally  then physically the next day and asked if that was acceptable only to get a response when it was too late dude if he fails me im gonna be so pissed
course didnt have a brightspace and no coherent syllabus
yeup im gonna do that first thing
yeah well have to see what happens maybe he will pass me but i doubt it he seems like a real bastard
seriously most go out of their way to help you get along in the class my worst case scenario is that i need an elective to graduate which really suks but not the end of the world
yeah just big buzz kill but im not stressed my only regret is taking his class ill fight tooth and nail if he does fail me
i broke the chain i just need to get the device off my ankle
ok man ttyl
dude i decided to pick up unity again got some game ideas i wanna make and im torn between unity and phaser
i also am learning javascript so my though is to not spread my self out too thin thought
whats up my dude i ended up going from an f to an a lol
lol tell me about  it yea i am in waterloo right now job hunting and working on a simple app
you going right to ottawa
may june july aug in toronto
we can for sure catch up
thats what i figured a lot of my freinds and family live there so ill be back and forth
dude we are the thumbnail httpsyoutubeowhfbsxdwyk httpprntscrcommbrts9
made me cringe lol didnt expect to see it
i look like a child lol you look like an anime character
lmao a mans man yea man id say u got a pretty epic pose
lmaoooo dont be so hard on yourself what have you been working on as of late
ah dude im learning the same thing
i have a udemy course youtube and the offical documentation
yup thats the one
i also have another one that glosses over it it covers other topics not just node
i got a couple gigs to do webdevelopment so it could be a little side hustle of mine
my friends band needs a website and one of their artist friends needs a portfolio page also
ye i also have the opportunity to make an app that already has 2 customers why are u learning node
nice same here gonna try some webbased game dev in the future and use nodejs also its powerful man and i really like the javascript
yo i got lots of ideas one im activley working on and one thats on the back burner until this one is finished also many more floating around interested in working together
ok well my current project is making an attendance tracking system using vuejs for the ui
firebase
i dont think it uses sql i know its a nonrelational database basically i create the application with vue and hook it up to the firebase and thats that
xd so the one im most passionate about but that is on the back burner untill i build up my programming proficiency is what i call checkins
so there are many goal setting  habbit forming  personal help type apps like habbitrpg  beeminder  etc the idea behind checkins is that you pledge for
personal integrity for now but some goals can be validated in other ways i think its valuable because so many people will for example buy some new running shoes so they can get in shape but never use them
people could lie but we would still profit it would still profit
well i have a few ideas on how to monetize one could be a subscription type scheme but that is unlikley to gain traction so  money would be made via affiliate marketing or merchandize sales
sounds good dont be moonlighting
not entirely sure i have
i see so you what i assume is that you create a platform that others gain value from
that makes sense so its a book
ill have to check it out
ahh like make little accountability groups
thats a good idea make it so that people pursuing the same goals can connect with eachother
habbit rpg has it as a feature they call guilds and there are other coaching apps but they are expensive
yes indeed im still trying to hammer our the technical skills i need i can follow tuts fine but havent gotten to the level of where i need to be yet
good idea i actually thought of including that into checkins also the thing is that there area few well established services for that namley coachme
how could we incentivse these people to spend there time on this
hmm thats an interesting concept i never took into coincideration altruism how would the business be profitable
only conflict would be relying on altruism to get value then monetizing that value could be a potential conflict you down to colab on this idea and make it a reality
hey frank it was nice to meet you at the library today i just got home and i took some pictures to show you the problem i have with the setup of the printer heidi sent a photo
i didnt know there was a tech shop ill try it tmr is that on the first floor
okay thanks
im going to attend a dinner later today hbu
thats great
nope i got invited by s friend to her res i have a meal plan
not at all i spend most of my time studying i dont have many chances to make friends
nope
we wont have a test till next monday im very used to crunching
i dont think crunching is the best way for studying i may change it gradually yeah i actually understand him
ive been working on a chem online assignment for a long time its really annoying i tried to google all the questions but theres no result for some of them i dont even know how to start
you missed a call from heidi
sorry i clicked on the wrong button
heidi sent a photo i know the answer of my second question is not right
yeah ive got the first blank right
104
yeah i did all three questions but only the second one was wrong which is odd cuz i used the second one to get the third one
yeah i used the same formula as you mentioned my first one and the third one are right its just the second one
i tried and its incorrect ive used up my attempts heidi sent a photo do you know how to get this one
i calculated delta v and used wpdelta v
so it should just be 168272
alright
alright thanks
its fine this assignment is taking me forever and i kinda just want to warp it up regardless of the result heidi sent a photo
heidi sent a photo do you know what this stands for
so it indicates how much energy is released when somethings burned
alright
no im just working on the questions
sorry for bothering you i feel kinda frustrated after working on these questions for half a day
thats cool i wish i could have time for napping
hey frank do you wanna study for algebra test tmr
k where do you wanna meet up
okay have you asked quassim it seemed that he wanted to join
nope ill do it later
okay
actually i think it would be more convenient if we meet at the campus i have a meal plan so its better to stay at the campus all day
studying area next to the dinning hall like we always do how about 100 pm
alright see you then hey man are you on your way to the campus yet
alright never mind i thought your res is far away from the campus
im struggling between keep studying or having a nap i got up too early and now im super tired
alright ill stay cuz im here already im going to the gym in like 20mins
yup wheres minto
oh alright is that the one at monpetit
 ive never been to that one maybe i should check it out today im reaching site  now see you there
k is this the main entrance heidi sent a photo never mind the shower here is kinda weird ill just change and leave
k see ya im at the dining hall
okay are you doing anything for halloween heidi sent an event link
yup you have to buy ticket online though ps the drinks there can be expensive so its better to get yourself half drunk before you go
less than 10 you can buy it via a link just go and check out the event
my roommate and her friends its a good chance to meet some new people you need a costume though
go to a dollar store and get something from there you can paint your face if you like
the pub opens at 9 its better to get there early
you told me that you could be kiri right
sure
definitely
im just gonna prepare things for halloween
ill be there around 9915pm meet at the pub
tequila jacks
me either its just a matter of be brave and meet new people if you like you can come over to friel around 850 and well go together
haha actually at this point i dont even know if anyone actually wants to go i have bought my ticket so i kinda have to go now
thanks its a very last minute idea so
actually its better to come around 830ish we can do pre drink together heidi sent a photo
heidi sent a photo this is the only thing im making
haha i actually had a plan a long time ago i was just wondering if i really want to do something for halloween
yeah being a cat is very basic but i like cats what do you wanna be have your prepared your costume yet
sure heidi sent a photo done
cost me 250 in total
thats not much either heidi sent a photo ticket
sure
im studying bio
two weeks later ill have my bio and physics minders on the same day
yup
alright i have a pair of scissors here ibe done everything i need to to except for pre drink
lemme know if you are downstairs
k coming heidi sent a video heidi sent a photo heidi sent a photo heidi sent a photo good time
heidi sent a video here you go
its fine nobody would care at that pointð
we are having an event called tacks and tequila tonight at 7 pm on friel do you wanna join 5 for each individual
theres no ticket for it its an event held by my roommate and her friends
sure hope you get better
yeah 1pm at the old spot
do you know the range of this midterm is that from very beginning up to matrices
yeah
sure im just here studying by myself
i just finished it hopefully its better than the last time
i believe there was a question like that on one of the tests
32  112  120 the coordinate vector in this case is 11
it felt better than the last time
p and q
p1 and q3 i cant remember
its no point to conspire answers after a test anyway compare
sorry but i have to review for midtermsððð heidi sent a photo studying
or the week after the next week whenever i feel like alive again
i didnt until you answered a question lol
nope why
nah hes an international student so he probably didnt have time to get a number yet
do you want to go to the gym later the one in montpetit
lets say around 545pm
see ya
okay heyy heidi sent a photo do you know why colar4 i can only understand why dim kera1
alright i didnt realize theres a relationship between rank and rn
hey frank
im sorry for bothering you but do you have the off document of the past tests i cant open the website this morning
yeah
include answer keys right
all test 4 hhu100uottawaca gosh thanks i was so nervous this morning
lemme try

thats the page ive been trying to access all morning heidi sent a photo
okay thanks
alright
k i got them thank you
okay i doubt if ill have any time for partying at all cuz exams are coming well see
oh thanks ive started reviewing for it a few days ago
haha that day will never come all i can do is to remember as much stuff as possible ill still try though
sure my goal is to get at least a 60
nope
theres no question on linear transformation for the final the prof just told us
heidi sent a photo i still dont get this after checking the answer do you know why
so only nn matrices can be li
oh
thanks have a nice day
sure ill have exams on 15th so im still preparing its gonna take a long time

i need to though i have a meal plan i also have to figure out where my exams will he held be
alright
yeah man thanks merry xmas have a great holiday ill see you in the next semester
man im feeling stressed out at home i was insulted by someone i really trust her words were nasty i dont know what to do now i have nobody to talk with
my guardian she is a close fiend of my parents
i know i did something wrong as well but today she just started yelling at me and call me a fucking nasty slut she did i was even trying to calm her at the beginning cuz shes pregnant
she wouldnt stop even when i ran upstairs to avoid further conversation
im just really upset right now
about 20 mins
she is a nice lady but sometimes she yells really hurtful things at me
yeah she does
but this is the second time already
in this july
alright
i still gotta spend a few days in her house and idk how to spend the rest of my break i feel for my parents sake she would but do this at this point would not
when she is outrageous she wouldnt let me talk i feel she has mental problem but she refuses to admit it
sure thank you
oh gosh haha you are always working on programmingð
i believe most people only have a few close friends
its been great i went to many places and enjoyed food at many restaurants
i went to pacific mall the one in markham
i did some shopping and i got the second manicure in my life it doesnt make too much sense to talk about manicure with a guy hahað did you at least enjoy the food there
thanks its a hobby i developed in high school
haha i see
i have never played a horror game are they good
humm
i actually love watching horror movies my last one was human centipede 2 i only want to watch the second one cuz its the best among the tree three
its really gross i almost quit half way through it am i a messed up personð
i guess sometimes i am i am a gemini so i kinda have dual personality
i believe you have seen both
my mom said that the two germinis my dad and i drive her crazy constantly
which is very true in my opinion
well enough to pass all my classesð
how did what go
for algebra nope the marking was alright
yeah i think i watch the second one
it was good its definitely scary i dimmed my light and lit some candles when i watched it i like to creat atmosphere when i watch horror movies
that sounds very fun its fun to get scared with your friends do you have problem falling asleep afterwards i normally just fall asleep right away after watching a horror movie
that is why they are good haha getting scared can become an addiction don you think you can build your tolerance of getting scared
yeah i got scared easily when i was little
haha i had problem walking in the dark for a long time
yeah totally ððð
its fine i actually liked it
like whom
i see both are pretty difficult to handle
my mother has nice temperament my father is slightly worse but he is okay in general i rarely have anger issue but when i do people get freaked out hbuð
thats really nice dont you get pissed off sometimes
you should record what she said and report this to hr if she yells nasty things to you at work place its her fault
well you have to protect your own rights i will start to do the same thing if she does this to me again
no
yeah they give me anxiety
i told her about my personal life and i trust her but she hurts me so i guess i should not tell her about anything next time
sure we were taking about relationships and she told me that my life style would affect my love life i agreed with her but i didnt want to change myself just to get a man
sure
i agree i did apologize but she wouldnt listen
i guess not it was in the middle of the argument
we both are
yup
she thinks she can keep doing this and i wont leave her be use of it becuase
she knows that i need her in my life and that becomes my weakness
my parents would get worried if i dont have her in canada
not really but she insisted that should come back to her place during xmas my res is closed during xmas unfortunately she likes me and another kid she takes care of but she gives us anxiety sometimes
okay she is that type of person whos nice to people around her but once you get close to her she will hurtful things to you idk how to describe it
i might really have to cut her off at some point even it means that l lose help idk i am basically alone in canada and i dont feel like losing people so quickly
absolutely
yeah
thats very true thanks for your suggestion
no im fine with the way you talk i feel i will either grow up real quick or end up on the street without her
in reality i still own her a debt because of something i did in high school i need to pay her back when i start to earn money she did me a big favor
yeah start earring money asap
thanks for your suggestion
i am at a stage where i try to figure out what i truly want
its a meaningful conversation though
okay man i feel its time to go back to programming eh i dont wanna waste your time here
have a good night
thanks man happy new yearð
she is calm again thank god

how about tomorrow i have an appointment at 430 today
1130
so u understand paging
ok ðð»
i am sure i understood but i will read again tonight
the idea is the page table is in the main memory hierarchy paging reduces the size of table in memory
i am at school now
yeah
i can find answers online
jinyang sent a photo that is my answer
partitions is that u can allocate one process in different places when u say partition do u mean segmentation and paging
u can load two in one
it only restrict that the process cannot bigger than the partition i am reading the slides
the bookâs answer used twice i think when one process in the partition the rest of the partition is called the hole
for os 711 to 713 is our assignment that is the solution of the book
i am not sure i will ask prof later
i never tried to search them
haha ok
i think u right two processes cannot in one partition
donât know why all solutions online did that way
i have already received marks i think
he post an announcement to tell how to compile on mac
i used eclipse
sorry i used intellij u have to import the two jar files
yes

so much rambling and too many analogies i forget what hes even talking about how did you find the lab
on the assignment oh the lab
ya it was long
no such luck it wasnt hard though thankfully have you looked the digital systems lab
hahaha i take it what we have to do before the lab is in the preparation section its pretty short

hehehe
pretty good i accomplished pretty much nothing
how is yours
for math i feel like i have so much time to spare now that this assignment isnt due breakfast time
hmmm im not sure i feel he sort of said everything is mixed together and we just have to figure it out hahaha

you too i wont just gotta get the 1121 assignment done first
this assignment wasnt so bad
i have a question for you though did you make it so that if the user doesnt input an integer the program doesnt crash
the description of that method says get a valid index of a card to be removed from computerdeck 		note this method does not check that the input is indeed an integer and 		will crash if something else is provided
i know for the python one i did a try and except thing but that descirption makes is sound like we dont have to
thanks
the unicode wont show up on my command line just question marks
stupid unicode
is it question marks on your computer too
it was the phone interview today i think i much prefer phone interviews not so stressful
he talked a lot about the company asked me about my resume about my degree in biology
no he was interested to know how i finished a degree in biology if i didnt feel that passionate about it
hehehe right
me too unless i want to do a masters
hahaha im pretty sure i wouldnt i want to finish as fast as possible
nope not yet
its due tomorrow right
i will have to do it tomorrow have to go out for my sisters birthday
haha uozone wont load annoying
i do but i wanted to double check the due date assignment says tomorrow at midnight
i will go with this
mhmm such a busy semester right from the start a litttle question she says do 19 cde my book does not have an e does yours
mighty strange
ahhaahah im looking at 119 not 19 what an idiot
thanks
i should get to school by 205 we can also discuss after 1121 if need be
i just got to school missed my connecting bus   is after class ok
on it
i find it odd that this example report never actually mentions the formulas for the circuits
will do
i will send you what ive done you can tell me if you want me to change things and im not sure if there are more sections i need to do allie sent an attachment did  you do prelab
are you sure want to send it to me later or i can look it over in lab tomorrow its not due until friday
ok hmm if and ab have a bar on top of them is that equivalent to a and b or is it a and b woah a and b
ok good this is what i thought thank you im going to photocopy the prelab this time so i dont have to redo it
mhmm man drawing complex circuits is hard
5270100 sorry
thats fine but we dont hand it in in lab its due online on friday
if you go on blackboard to labs to lab 1 lab 1 report
he must be or the head coordinator im not sure definitely receive emails from him in any case better safe than sorry
it would make more sense if it were due tomorrow
right
can do the prelab is slowww
so very long
sure its intereting but its tedious
finishing the first part
sounds good
i have an interview at 1
hmm perhaps 12
i think maybe were only supposed to submit one prelab together i saw this from last weeks lab
wooohooo would you still like to meet at 12 or just combine stuff in lab
yup
ok i might have to just leave my answers with you so i have a few minutes to prepare for my interview
im going to read over some of the stuff i prepare for my last interview and read up on the company a bit more
right hmm i could also just send you my answers
i jusssst finished so long i shall scan it
ok ill send it to you anyway for fun
or i could use that time to prepare myself hmmm hehehe professor scot send us an email but directed it to mat1341
if you havent submitted the lab yet ill look it over today
ive got everything in my google calendar
hhehe no i mean i put all the due dates in my google calendar and that its always emailing and notifying me that i have things due
thats fun i just want to know whether im going to have to do more interviews
true but only if i get a placement otherwise its just time taken away from school
yup i will
allie ó° oops you too
did you see the iti1100 email
no about a lecture this saturday
hello students  next thursdays lecture on feb 9th 1130am to 100pm will be moved to this coming saturday feb 4th 100pm to 230pm at site g0103 i will not take attendance  regards  professor hao no thank you i say
mhmm i have learnt nothing in class
part 1 of the lab
i feel like maybe shes just not my style of learning is it hard havent looked at it yet
hehehe no offence taken
a lot harder than the last assignment
ya and in this class i think the material is very applied need to learn by doing
she has such good ratings in rate my prof on
hmmm this is not my first priority in a prof
i do forever had no problem with those assignments and she was so clear with what she wanted for everything
what a sad life
pretty good some of the instructions arent exactly clear i think the person who makes the instructions is french
pretty certain and sometimes they day marcelle turcotte thats also definitely a french name
yup
ya  not well though ya montreal west island
you never know though i think some places probably want people who havent picked up bad habits so they can mold them
mhmm
will not and ill message you after i do so you can be sure its in
i will 100 remember not to worry
thank you submitted
are you going to go to class today
hmmm i think ill go there be like 9 people there i bet
i have to go down town any way why is class today instead of thursday
is the class always going to be on saturday
more than i thought would
no it took me forever to find parking and then i dont even think i listened
i took one line of notes driving my boyfriend to his place
did you do assignment 2 yet
me too
mhmm this is going to be an easy week
good idea
um is a and a the original formula
then its a contradiction but to prove it i guess you would negate it and then find that theres at least one open branch hmm no that only shows its not a taut ology
ohhh a and a thats a taut ology sorry no no its not its either neother
hmm one sec i think this just proves that its not a tautolgy no that its a contadiction cause you end up with two not a branches right
ya so when you negated and show that there are open branches this shows that its a not a tautolgy it doesnt show that its a contradcition and then all branches are closed but in this case theyre not
dont think so i could be wrong
doesnt makes sense to me because then youre showing that the negation is a tautology in essence and in order to show that something is a tautology you have to show that no branches or open for its negation
exactly so you cant conclude taht the negation is a contradction
for the case you were saying all branches are open for a and a but this does not automatically mean that its a tautology so it doesnt automatically mean that a and a is a contradiction it just means a and a is not a tautology
no open branches for the negation
ya
my understanding is that you can show something is a contradiction by showing that there are no open branches
and you can show something is a tautology by showing that its negation is a contradiction ie has no open branches oh he may have want me to check my notes
good idea its possible im just making this stuff up ahahah
probably havent started studying yet but i have a good chunk  of tomorrow to do that i have to shovel now and oh boy i just do not want to1
my shoulders are sore and i just know my dog is going to bark at me i will listen to a pocast i think
oh i just ended up listening to a very dumb one and now the driveway is all snowy again
we dont need to go to lab today right
hmm tomorrow is quite swamped for me friday is very free for me though and its not due til the friday after we got 100 on the first one woohoo
friday february 17 2017 1159 pm in 10 days
mhmm plenty of time
that is a big day are you ready for your interviews
entrepreneurial midterm
ya those labs are a lot of work for few points good luck with the studying
i messed up the truth tree i dont know why i did it just know and it took 2 seconds i think i just wasted too much time on the first couple of questions
so long
i didnt check it over i put the right counterexample by looking at the equations for the truth tree but i didnt finish my truth tree it was so long we essentially have 5 midterms
oh well i just took my time too much at the beginning dont know what i was thinking do you know what it was out if didnt even notice that
just the first few i was just taking my time making truth tables i should have checked to see how long the test was i was a fool hahahaha
yup maybe this one will be my not counting one
if you insist
hehehe it would be nice if your exam could replace any tests that were lower no matter how many
im not sure i dont know if she ever said i took mat1341 many many years ago
the prof was hard to understand
hes easy to understand
nope thats true i havent finished 1100 assignment yet but im going to do 1121 lab now instead so i can leave at 7 instead of 10 tomorrow
yup and an assignment in professionalism
i still did not accomplish enough this weekend this weekend i must accomplish everything
its a good question well i was sick this weekend so there was lots of napping
not fully
could be
probably who ever knows
hmmm oh boy i do not want to do work
who is this strange 1
i like doing work sometimes but right now just seems like a bunch better time for bed
i sure do apparently i work well under pressure
if i started things earlier i would never stop tinkering
did you finish 1121 assignment 2
i hope we get our marks back for assignment 1 before we have to submit 2
so i know if im not doing something exactly the way they want it
i think all 1121 lectures should be labs instead 2 3 hours labs excellent idea
this is true
professionalism would be a lot more fun and useful then and i would get paid otherwise it wouldnt be very professional
haha i supose so one of the jobs i interviewed for was cancelled ð
6 but 2 i dont want
ya so 4 i will know in 145 hours if they all dont want me
i will hope a little i have told myself its ok if no on wants me i shall just have to do more interviews and thats good practice one
we shall see i am horrible at intrerviews have you gotten a mark for lab 3 i have not
curious and i havent gotten any marks for the quiz portion
hahaha it just seems very disorganized i think lab marks might just be 0 or 100 i must find out so i dont waste too much time on this i will ask tomorrow
hmmm
oh man thats scary
did you think you put all your scantron answers off by one or something
one time i had a prof give me a final grade of c when i was meant to have an a
well i was confused cause i went into the exam with an a and i didnt feel i had done poorly on the exam but i emailed the prof and she said nope you got a c
this was an elective witchcraft
yup the average was surprisingly low
srs1101
nope just seemed like an easy a
hahaha
i would have been burnt by the witches probably they burnt a lot of people with reddish hair
yup sorry not by the withces by the witch hunters but only for having reddish haird i mean no one was actually burnt for being a witch i think a witch would be too clever for that
i think it was all just a bunch of sexism
you could take it as an elective or just read harry potter
ya i dont think youd like this course prof wasnt the greatest
ya it ended up being changed to an a of course but she caused me stress
have fun
good luck on your interviews
hmm thats frustrating
mhmm
yes the one i wanted most wants me most ð sooo ill be working at interset this summer
thank you im so happy
interset
httpsintersetcom
interset has unlocked the power of behavioral analytics machine learning and big data to find and surface threats before they can steal your data
hmmm i have references on my coop resume but i dont know if anyone called them
one of my former bosses is my friends husband ill ask her tomorrow mhmm i really didnt think i was going to get a job
hehehe oh i am super awkward in interviews this one i wasnt that awkward in though they were really relaxed
i think i definitely got better with the number of interviews phew this job is in kanata of course and im in the east end ð
oh no in kanata whereabouts
hmmm off march road
hehehe i used to volunteer at a farm deep in north kanata sooo far
oh yes i know march roadish area ottawa silicon valley
hahahshs
hmmm i think we only have to hand in one
look at you go
i guess ill look it over so im ready for the lab
and how do you want to lab 2 report
haha ok
thank you have you received a mark for 1121 assignment 1
thanks
nope
yup
ya just gotta zip it did you write our own javadoc comments or basically use what was provided
i noticed that on piazza section a there are quizzes are we suppose to be doing these
very odd i made a few corrections to the prelab ill print both so you can double check
if you want i could do all of the lab report that is due this friday since you did everything in the lab yesterday unless yoube done your part of course
i could send it to you to look over
go for it i dont mind
sounds good
i will so 1100 class is in the church tomorrow
hmmm doesnt sound ideal
neither do i
nope i think im just looking for a reason to feel like i shouldnt go hahaha
nope just didnt go today did he say anything note worthy
ya did he say anything about the midterm
hmmm did he say anything i wont be able to figure out on my own
excellent thank you
niceee are you excited
yes that is always a good feeling
it will be very excitimg for me
ya i do like coding
hahaha
ya i can see that i think its probably also hard to catch up if you dont get it right away
ya a lot of the college programs have high drop out rates
it was excellent
i was wrong
hahaha i felt really rushed and then he was so mad at everyone
as we speak
ohh yes the 1121 was long and the quiz i just didnt know what they were looking for so i just made the code work allie sent an attachment i mostly copied the conclusion from the last lab
i feel i already said that maybe ill just say it more explicitly
will do
oops sorry umm i know how to get the equation and then do it
mhmm yes yes you de morgans it i showed that in the report
should i say this is so amazing it just seems all very intuitive and self explanatory but i shall do it
my least favourite part of a report is this discussion but i will confirm that we learnt what we were supposed tom did you finish 1121 lab
it didnt leave much room for figuring stuff out and the quiz was vague i also dont understand a single thing my ta says
and i dont understand his hand writing on the chalkboard he seemed to say we didnt have to worry about most of it but who knows what he meant by that
moved all over the place
in all its beautiful colours
how very odd why do you lied the discussion i dont care for words your ta must give your better instructions did you have to do the other parts as well
oops i meant like
interesting our ta also told us to submit counter and timer
very interesting
oh did you want to see the lab again before i submit it
ya worth so little its so silly
its in
no problem
you too
this weeks lab is the lab we completed last week 2 weeks ago
no
look at the schedule lab 3 14 and 28 feb woohoo
stop that study for one of the midtermstest
oooh are you ready mine too i think its also ridiculous that we have assignments due next monday in 1000 and 1121 right after the midterms
very stressed we can try i havent looked at it yet though c no c
ok i will look at it this evening this weeks lab is on stacks that will make things easier
ok i will work on it on my own im not sure i will finish it before the midterm
is it hard so far
uhoh
do you happen to know if our midterm is the same as section b and cs
so guis arent on it then
hmm that seems misleading then it says it was from 5 days ago
this  remember that the midterm will be sunday march 5th in the morning ill post the details here exact time location etc i encourage you to look at past years exams httpswwweecsuottawacaturcotteteachingiti1121examinationsindexhtml in terms of content everything is on except gui
and we had definitely already covered guis 5 days ago
i dont like how professor announcements are all mixed in on piazza they should be on blackboard assignment 3 deadline has been extended to next friday i had a feeling that might happen
this semester is so disorganized
me too
they should have or at least had a section at the end where you covered the basic stuff or just have vida teach everything
she has experience teaching 1120 in java though
hahaha yes of course just figured you didnt want to be spending your time on the wrong things
hmmm nope
hmmm i tried googline it
the external gates seem to be the gates outside of the decoder you know the or gates outside of the decoder
ya or an and gate for an active low decoder
ya active high implements and sop so it has an external or gate an active low implements a pos so it has an external and gate
no encoders on this midterm i wonder why the main difference between a decoder and a demux demux has data input
they basically seem to be the same
hmmm seems like you do the same thing with them either way thanks do you think there will be questions about altera
nope i imagine everything upto and including index 12 except for guis index 8 hmm index 8
we only did 13 on thursday
no wednesday and on wednesday he said he hadnt seen the midterm yet
i probably did to the last question right didnt do
ya still not sure i did it right though
23 of the test was bonus point ive never seen that before
really thats ridiculous
hmm i think ive signed attendence at least 3 times are you ready for tomorrows midterm
i hope i am as well
i am slow on tests though i always work right up to the last second did you do the prelab yet if not i will do it tomorrow and the data processing for the lab report
ill do it you like discussion i like processing good job
yup im not at home right now but i can scan them to you tomorrow
ok my notes are at home too though
ok sounds good
black board just posted a mark for the midterm we wrote this morning how is that possible
uhoh c average i found i didnt have enough room to write
hmm strange and i write small usually
i expected some true or false or some multiple  choices like the past ones
yes there were multiple choice true or false questions in most of the recent midterms did you finish the test
you didnt modify the statistics class that was the last question
nope there were essentially only 3 questions the mark is out of 70 eh not 100
a
im pleased i was worried for this one
we still havent gotten an assignment 2 mark youll have to go see it
allie ó° oops no like i dont know sometimes they hand them back sometimes they dont
we shall maybe these are randomly generated marks i dont believe theyre graded them this fast
ive decided im going to jourdans lectures from now on since he seems to make the tests
will do according to rate my prof he sucks one more thing did you get a mark for 1100 lab 2 report
i will ask ta on tuesday cause its not even showing up as to be marked
this other prof is better he actually codes in class
theres monday 1130 thursday 100 and wednesday 400 friday 230
same class as our class
yup
yup im going to do it
because they have automatic coop
niceee
good sounds like a nice relief
hehehe well maybe a little tiny bit of trying
hahaha well you certainly dont have to try if you dont want to
that sounds like a good plan assignment two marks are up
ohhh sorrry
i did alright havent started 3 though
uhohhh
oh you made it sound like a scary task
oh ok in case you wanted to see this
pheww allie sent an attachment
the assignment havent stated
thank you so much now i must go to bed tomorrow i will finally find and remember to send you those notes have a good night did you go to digital systems today
is there attendance
phewww i thin this is the lecture you need
okidoke thank you if you have any questions let me know
still no mark for the last oneð
thank you did i forget anything in the data processing stuff
phewwwwwwwww ugh we still have two more reports not very well spaced out
nope but that adds up
when you have a chance can you send me a copy of the lab
thank you
fun
theres no maximum size for the board eh
im about to start the viewer i anticipate this will take the longest
i slept 6 or 7 hours
maybe i am going it allllllll wrong
have you won the game ive only one once
of the one he linked on the assignment won
i suck at it apparently hopefully im better at making it
well the one he linked you only get 25 tries 25 colour selections
mhmm did you use grid layout for the dots
and border layout for the frame
hmm my grid is too big
its not all fitting in the window
ok one second so this is what it looks like
ya its the size of the grid tgats the probkem
ooh i think i got it1 my grid layout is like this jpanel board  new jpanel     boardsetlayoutnew gridlayout2020 it says 2020 right now cause thats what i was experimenting with
hmm it doesnt look like this weeks lab has a prelab weeks
doesnt seem to say preparation anywhere
me neither good news it this is a 2 week lab
hmmm what do you think we should do
hmm they may tell us to do one section or something well try to get away with doing as little as possible
i know nothing about anything
excellent 3 100s woot woot
hmmm is number 2 97
weird all i see are 100s but 2 says 100 and needs grading whatever that means
i must study did you want to do the discussion again for the lab thats due friday
okidoke i hate writting
okidoke
thanks i will do that either tonight after lab or tomorrow
a very generous bonus i wonder if anyone got 130
i know
you think so
thats giid i dont know whether i did we dont get it back eh
i guess i will never know
i like to know so i can know what im doing wrong know what my weaknesses are do be on the look out for them to
hahaha sorry for the delay
i took too much cough syrup and slept for 15 hours
feeling much better today thanks
ok due tonight let me know if you need any help
true woah true
looks great thanks
i got 97 on the first and 100 on the second havent gotten a third mark have you
i think that could work if you send me what you have i could finish it
i would think by sunday night i have a presentation tomorrow
whats going on monday for yjou
ohhh your big project is due
ohhh that doesnt sound fun
oh no
only two weeks left
i think i may skip 1100 havent done last nights lab yet
thanks
form a group a group on blackboard
yes i think thats all you have to do
ok thanks yes uottawa is far behind and cheap
ok
okidoke
okkk
its going not to worry
i think im done the last part but ive got to do my documenting and ill probably fiddle around with it some more
ok
i dont think diagonal works properly
yup
130 how much time do you think we need
ok 130
i think everything else is working just fine but something is not right with the diagonal
sureee i feel bad though you did way more work
hahaha i changed the setting window to a joptions thing seems to be want he wants
yup its all the same
i just god rid of the frame
i think i have to show you its just not capturing properly
nope
ya i copied the files and made modifications to those ones so i have both ya its deinitely a problem in the orinigal files
hmm i dont think so digonally should be all 8 around it
it actually seems to work if you have it in torus and diagonal but it doesnt seem to work for diagonal planar
okkk i shall send you a video
cause even the diagonal diagonal isnt working i think i might be 145 have to hop in the shower
are you going to class after math
okidoke see you soon
oh but i will also see you at 145
sorry im trying to find parking and im stuck behind a garbage truck thats not moving
i will check in gamecontroller eh i dont see that the only while loop is in flood hmm im wondering if you switch it to diagonal in the middle of the game should flood be called
no it does look like it makes sense though
hmm i just put a flood in and it looks better
i just think for the markers it might look like we didnt acheive what were supposed to
no it would only be if there are dots of the current colour
i will leave it without
we may never know but i did not find this while loop you are talking about i did my assignment 3 soemwhat oddly apparently i made my captured stack an instance variable
ya but that way i didnt have to interate over all the dots each time to check if they were captured its interesting seeing different solutions
i made a temp stack when i popped an item i put it in the temp stack i think this game is all done i will play around with it a little longer see if i notice anythin g
then i will do the javadocs and sumbit it or do you want me to send it to you first
oh hahah nope i didnt even know they were up
just playing with this game
yup i dont have a merk mark maybe they are doing antialphabetical
peculiar my computer is a mess i end up downloading things from blackboard so many times
i will i will do a good end of semester cleaning
yup just gonna change one thing to see if the game is finished you just have to check if the number captured is the same as the size squared
thats what im saying th is finished function doesnte need to use a for loops
it just has to check that number capture is the same as size squared
ohh i see i will just add in allie sent an attachment
are assignment wont get in trouble for being similar to others right
didt copy anyone
didnt share with anyone no idea just reading over the submission requirements i think i can submit ya
did it
thank you for working with me
how do you want to so lab 5 report
sounds good uoh changes to settings are also supposed to be part of undo
oh cool
in 32 a undo feature
oops yes i think i do
yup no problem first im going to snoop around on piazza and make sure these undoable settings are necessary
and some people are saying reset should be undoable that doesnt sound right to me
and it deginitely doesnt say that anywhere allie sent an attachment i think its good now i got rid of that instance variable too and changed what i was doing with the panel cause it was kind of stupid
seems to
there you go the final and most up to date version the end
mhmm i could go on tinkering forever but ive had quite enough need to study math
so no lab right
i dont think im going to have this done tonight but i cant have it to you in the morning my mind is mush today
ok good sorry
allie sent an attachment finally done sorrrry
yes
ohhh scared me there yes yes goos good stuff
hmm nope never thats very odd
thanks
up to you if youve already done 70 im fine with doing it separately
works for me no lab tomorrow fairly certain
so very chill
ooooh very nice and my 3 hour class ended two weeks ago
mhmm i should start studying for digital
did you ever hear anything about why you didnt have a ta on friday
ohhh frustrating i bet it was my regular ta
are you going to go this review session for iti1100 tomorrow
have you ever been to one of these student review sessions
if they give hints about the exam that seems like a useful thing
i was really just wondering what they were like and whether youd been as ive never been and dont want to go if its going to be useless like some of the dgds thanks anyway
thats very true they should switch everything to online learning ok just got word from someone else they are very useless good luck with your studies
hi have you gotten marks for 1100 lab 4 or 5
thanks
one more question did you get your 1100 assignment 6 mark
weird she posted an announcement today saying if you dont have all your marks back today contact whoever asap
allie ó° oops i think ill wait til tomorrow do you happen to know if encoders are on the exam we skipped over them for the midterm for some reason
weird ok thanks hows studying going
ya its basically a logic test
i did a little studying yesterday and im going through some problems now
thanks
im not worried id like to get somewhere between an a and and a hopefully thats doable
you think so think there will be 9 mlllion bonus marks again
oh i meant a to a on the final alone
if you know your stuff you wont
ya im not sure marks matter that much at any age really so long as theyre good enough to get a job
that must have suckeddd
well glad you were able to get away from that
when do you start your job
oh nice thats good its not right away that would be a busy weekend for you where are you going
nope
that should be fun ya starting on the first last i heard i was starting on the first
but i was supposed to hear from them again and i havent so maybe theyre decided they dont want me
hahahah
hahaha ya i dont think they can actually do that hopefully i will email them next week ask them whether taking a summer course would interfere with my hours
hahahah that would be hilarious they seemed pretty cool i dont think theyre be jerks like that
i do now
i didnt like how the professor kept talking throughout it very distracting
ya im glad she gave extra time cause she stole so much of it
i think i did hopefully
mhmm
apprently we have a course next semester that is part two of this thouhg
i enjoy the material but its tedious and i dont really think ill ever use it oh well whens your next exam
nice i think my next one is 10 days from now so spread out
perfect
have fun
thanks did you see we got 100 on assignment 4 woohoo thanks for working with me
me neither ate too much chocolate watched some movies
which conic comic
comics are quite addictive suck you right in
i know the word manga hahaha i think most people do
mhmm i guess i will start studying today
blah ya my next one is sunday night
no professionalism
im hoping its like the midterm it was multiple choice and took 10 minutes to write
its a 7 to 10pm exam blah
the best
have fun dont let the manga suck you back in
hmm you will find out shortly i assume did you see the email from the prof you should email him asap about your missing grade
phewww
a binary relation is a pair so the set of all binary relations is all possible combinations of pairs
i dont know if that makes sense
that would be all the possibly pairs but then you can take all the possible subsets of that set ie the power set
hahaha so you have the set of all possible pairs but then you have all these possible relations that only take some of these pairs
it could be
if theres a relation that each of those pairs and only those pairs satisfies
yes
buttt were looking at what satisfies that relationship a pair is one instance that satifies that relationsjip
but there could be multiple pairs for each binary relation there is a set of pairs that satisfies that relation
but i havent actually study this part so maybe dont take my word for it hahaha
oh good1
i guess maybe a way to think of it is a binary relation is not the pair itself its a rulecondition that needs to be satisifed  and on a given set there are diffent possible pairs that satisfiy that relation
hmm maybe i am wrong then
i havent started studying yet
im not quite sure
went to the eye doctor got those drops put in my eyes so i couldnt see
went to beauty and the beast this exam schedule has been so drawn out ive lost motivation
48 hours and 10 minutes til were done woohoo
hmm maybe i should be more worried
i dont need perfect maybe an a thatll do
so probably an a on the exam
youll get that he seems to be quite a fair prof so i dont think hell put any surprises on the exam
no harm in trying hard
this is true stress is no fun
advice do some yoga
occasionally go rock climbing go for a run remind yourself that a bad mark probably wont matter in the grand scheme of life
havent cried this exam cycle so i conider it a success hahah
stress is sneaky its hard to see outside of it when youre really stressed
mhmm it certainly isnt about grades and school should really be about learning what you need to succeed in your field and exams definitely dont always reflect that
true but if you dont get into software engineering you can always do computer science and youll probably end up in the same job any way
maybe i dont think they have a hard time though theres such a demand for people in the field college students dont even have a hard time
i suppose so
i like that computer science has more freedom ok enjoy your studies
haha no software engineering just has more mandatory courses where is comp sci you can choose between a number of courses
well then im sure you will get there i dont know enough yet i just like it all so far
that should be my official title
allie master programmer i like that
sounds fun
it certainly sounds fun maybe i can do a masters with vida
i think i would like to work for a while after i graduate though one day i can dream
i shall put that on a stick note sticky
me too what fun
byeee
mhmm im just waiting on math howd you do
nice me too
and then you will get into seg woohoo
no that wouldnt be fun
no point worrying about it nothing you can do now right
ya i have a hard time with it too
because i didnt know anything about computer scirnce before i came into the program and i didnt work nearly as hard as i could have which is probably good cause i think next semester will require more work
probably true this summer i should have some time
i guess i didnt make time for it
i shall try would also like to make time for non schoolwork stuff
nicely done you must be happy
mhmm have you started your job
ohhh lucky you its good i get to work from home today âº
ya apparently my team always works from home on wednesdays
ya the other days i go in
wouldnt that be nice
theyre pretty flexible about working from home but i dont want to push it seeing as im not an actual employee
ya its all open concept
ya i think if everyone worked from home all the time things could get pretty disjoint and confusing
i like it much more then any other job ive had but its also very different from all my previous jobs
what do you mean
im no sure what you mean about needing to worry about the work place politics
gotcha its a bunch of people with inflated egos
sounds frustrating
you sure can
thanks have a nice day
pretty good summer has gone so fast have you enjoyed your job
are you looking forward to school
i havent done my coop report yet looks awful
ya a week and a half
sure do
its been great a lot of independence in my work what classes are you taking this semester
yup 2110 2136 2105
im in 2110b ceg2136a seg2105c
hmm no i had a hard time getting into classes i think cause in technically in the faculty of science im also taking csi2372 c i hear the prof is awful though
thanks how come
nope next summer its not for me either its one among a few
ya and i got a weird coop schedule they told me i had to follow the option 3 sequence for whatever reason
you too
tuesday i believe at 4 i think the same one as you
ya i changed my schedule a bit do you have a lab partnerwould you like to be lab partners again
niceee
same here those labs are long and tedious apparently
this is my schedule now allie sent a photo
yaaaaa and im dropping the math courses course
i get to work part time where i did coop i think 5 courses with work will be too many
no thank youuu
oh im saying no thank you to 5 courses
niceee
im glad i dont have a bunch of evening courseslabs this semester those are the worst
ya but one of the ceg labs is 7 til 10 awful
we have seg lab today right
oh boy im going to be quite late
no i was finishing by coop report
yaaa cause i hate writing
does it look like an easy lab
ya
i was planning to take the 16 85 95 or 98
it should take about 15 minutes
probably 945
no problem
ok i guess we should go
im at work at the moment when is it due
i could look at it tomorrow i have an assignment due tomorrow that i must do after work today what conversation do you mean
i really like my job why do people say that i would say apply to all the jobs you can
especially ones that require cover letters because people avoid those ones
you can always apply for job outside the navigator
hmmm when can you start applying through the navigator
hmmm your plan is to use this project to help you get a job outside of the navigator
if you want to work for a big company try for it and apply to navigator jobs as back up
it goes pretty fast
your going to change your resume for each navigator job
ya that part is long
sureeee if youd like to
the group i worked with last week wouldnt listen to me when i tried to help them
ya and then the ta asked me if i was in the class after 2 hours i dont know what he thought i was doing there
no i think he just thought i was a weirdo and he called me maam
and told me i had to leave when it was 140 and theres no way a class was starting before 230 ya im sure hes younger but still a very strange dude
nope i dont know they didnt trust me
seriously i know some basic git cause i had to learn the hard way this summer using a gui is awful
ceg and seg i like this silly note in the ceg lab instructions in order to finish your experiment in the time allotted it is advisable that you stay at your workbench and not wander around the lab
its just silly that people need to be told that
good job
it appears i applied for 168 jobs through the navigator
i was placed in round 1 so that was just for round 1
more will become available though
i think we just do what is under prelab ya first round of interviews
hmmm seems odd but i guess so basically more jobs postings come out every days
i suppose so tommorrow
ya i will do it as prelab tomorrow i am getting much too sleepy
just looks like a basic review of how to use the program good night did you do part 1 and 2 seems there is no quartus for max mac
which lab did you go to
102 105 hmm i may just have time to go home and get my other laptop do you have a github account
i put the seg lab stuff on github whats your username
ok invited you to be a collaboratoe r
no probbb
hmm that is very strange i will try inviting you again
it might be because i made it private
it was public and then i got a student account and went back and made it private might have messed it up
do you need it tonight
ok i will do it in the morning then
just got in bed good night
when i search for you to add you as a collaborator i cant even find you now
i shall delete the repositroy and create a new one
still cant find you i dont understand
ok found you now i was putting a space ð
niceee where
ohhh whats that
umm i think before next weeks lab when is your interview
ya
at 1130 my birthday ð¤
yupppp i am going to oktoberfest tomorrow afternoon so is shall work on it in the morning sound good im at work right now and have a c assignment to finish for tonight
do you know anyone in c
sounds good to me too bad i need to find someone in c to be my partner for a project
okidoke
okidoke
ok i think the code for both is mostly done
i think do
i think i should dounle check with him
ummm i can later
okkk
okkkk right now this repository only contains assignment 1
ok
hahaha fair enough
ok
nope havent touched it
its not on your computer
sorry lost internet for a second
thats odd you could see it before
hmmm
ya might you have hidden it from yourself somehow
okkk yai dont know if thats a thing
ok i dont have a laptop right now but ill look into it later
ok i will look at it
yup
i think that maybe they are calculating the rotation this way because if theta is greater than 180 theta 360 so i can do a different implementation for this but its more than just adding the rotation angle
the way they have it
if theta is greater than 180  it is store as 360  te new angle the the angles range from 180 to 180
ok
cause thats what theyre returning when they convert to polar polar in the provided code
yes sorry ummm there just isnt really much to day say i wasnt sure what to add as im not sure what youve written allie sent an attachment
can you send it to me before you submit it
i made a few edits
allie sent an attachment just small things do you want me to submit it
okkk
ohh thank you
to submit it i submitted it this morning
woot woot
sorry i went to bed early my gift to myself was sleep thanks for doing the prelab i will do the next one i shall look at seg on my break 1 to 4
maybe he will mention it again
ya tomorrow
no my boyfriend did though
i think he loved it cause he gobbled it up
all their food is delicious
oh yes i looked at it looked good im going to ask him a question about part 2 tomorrow
yaaa just need to make a couple changes
i havent submitted seg yet
cause he said yesterday that the abstract class should have instance variables for xyrho and theta so i tried doing it this way but i dont think it makes sense what do you think
ok good
no it just doesnt make sense to me at all that you would have 4 different instance variables when youre only storing one pair or the other i think so too ok good
yup
we are on the same page then
true quite unclear hate that but perhaps thats the point have you received an email from him about group projects
yuppp
did you add your name to the google doc for the seg project
its not an email its an announcement on brightspace i got on a wrong bus i will be there in 10 sorrry
im on a roll today
mmm dont think so
seems weird that they wouldnt also interview you ð¤ i had ones where i had to code but i think they were just labelled interview did you know our lab report is due tonight
okidoke
did they even mention in lab that it would be due today i figured it would be due monday
watch well hand it in and theyll change it to monday
nope
its going i had a couple of appointments to view apartments that i had to go to
trying to so hard to find an apartment
i think my place has mould
yaaa sucks im allergic to mould and it seems to be chasing me my boyfriends place flooded a few weeks ago and they have to rip out the floors and the bottom 2 to 3 feet of the walls
ya i think its just a random counter swicthes is up
thank you
okidoke
i sure can
thank you
yaaa do you want to look at it before i submit it
httpswwwkijijicav2bedroomapartmentscondosottawahintonburg1303654425enablesearchnavigationflagtrue sounds like they may have taken out the carpet in the pictures the outside is ugly but maybe worth a look
i should email
ohhh hahaha
sorry i meant to message my future roommate hhehehe
thanks for your input though
we have to do a writeup
oh its my turn i started doing it earlier
but then i only had my phone and it was overwhelming
on the teeny tiny screen
meh i feel like a lot of professors suck at teaching
no unfortunately
hoe so how
ya hes engaging csi2110 sucks as does ceg
i work at interset
yes im almost done at 544
i am at home
getting in the shower do you think this quiz focuses on problem set 2 or 3
ya
yup
i will listen closely
no problem have a good rest
i learnt nothing he didnt even mention it
and what he did today isnt on the exam ya
i dont believe so
yaaa we got a mark for the first seg assignment the comments say we didnt do a test for design 5 i dont know why it says that cause we did actually neither of his comments make any sense
theyre so chaotic
oh great dont you just love that
yaaa ill be happy when its done with
yaaa its crazy i dont understand were paying to be there do you think we have to do k maps with more than 4 variables
good that would be insane
nope
is it a partber thing
partner
ohhh
i think we got 94
but the thing we were docked marks for made no sense
he said we had no tests for design 5 which is completely untrue yes i will and i will cc the prof
yaaaa and then we lost marks cause had instance variables in our subclasses but so did the solutions the prof provided
hehehe no prob i will start working on assignment 2 later this afternoon ill let you know how it goes
have you received a mark for 2110 assignment 1
no marks ever ohhh our waveform definitely isnt right but well deal with that after the break
its ok i know whats wrong i think
we will
excellent congrats
ya takes me about an hour
ya
when i bus from school its usually more like an hour and a half or more especially in the middle of the day
yup so many tech jobs in kanata
hmmm this assignment is confusing
are we allowed to modify the server in the first question or only the client
but not both
just seems in the very first question it would be good to modify both
i like that i will go with that
yup
there still hasnt been a mention of a code
this course is so subjective i hope the marking is easy
yaaaa
mhmm
i feel like the professor isnt even sure about what hes saying a lot of the time
mhmm meh whatever just gotta do it
hated that exam
took me too long to draw that damn diagram
reading week time woohooooooo
woot woot wooooot
we got 910 cause or state thing isnt right but our equations are our
i will start the lab report when i get home they arent the values theyre supposed to be she said most poeples were wrong
maybe we have another multiplexer somewhere with the select inputs reversed
i have quartus on my other lap top so i can fix it and get new screen shots for our report
we dont have a quiz today do we
phewww i am going to skip then
good idea i shall send you the lab report tonight
all of the above i lied my non mac laptop decided to update for an hour and a half so im not done yet
tomorrow at midnight 1130pm actually
yup
okidoke cant wait to be done with these labs
ya i think this is the last course like this for me i hope so anyway
so lucky
no not at all i wish he knew what he was talking about hes pretty good at keeping my attention
just he seems to contradict himself a lot and makes a lot of mistakes
maybe
perhaps
have a good night
yes i shall have it you by 3
httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd12i0dysvspp3sdzvzmbyj9ybdojfgwbqfsqze1tpkbqedituspsharing
oh fuck the figures didnt copy let me try again
allie sent an attachment google docs is garabage im up to status register god dammit now i have the spinning beach ball in word
you know when your mac freezes and the cursor turns into a spinning beach ball
whattt do you have a different cursor
allie sent a photo that guy its like the equivalent of the hour glass on windows
lucky
ya i am
and yes i believe i corrected the status outputs
the description of them is poor i think we had the outputs from the arithmetic circuit going to the state circuit instead of the outputs from the multiplexer that choses between arithmeticlogic
httpsenwikipediaorgwikistatusregister
but since i dont know what the results they have are i cant be certain oh shit i think they want to see it in hex form i will add those pictures too its all trivial and dumb
thank you
oh just dandy
just got smoosh this all together got to
yaaaaaa terrifying mannn
havent started it yet
gotta do my test classes for csi2110 i will probably eventually understand
i have 2110 lab after seg and then c lecture
530
but i wont be much help until ive gone through it
okidomem
what do you have before lab on tuesday
shoot
me too
sounds good no veg quiz today right
ceg hehehe no need to go then
well too late
i dont feel confident
ok stupid lab
i have a midterm wednesday this is a waster of time
hopefully it wont be too bad once we get going
weve got 4 weeks for this lab at least can maybe do some of it home too
that would be nice
woahhh your eyes must be bleeding
ya it is the machine code is pretty cool i like that
ya
ya but i like coding
i hate this stuff mostly because its so time consuming and tedious
good night
hi frank i didnt go to my lab this morning so im still at home can you go to office hours on your own if i come to school now ill be there for the rest of the afternoon and i know i wont do good studies and i really need to to some good studying
excellent
elmedia player
have fun hi frank
are you sure the quiz is wednesday and not tomorrow
and we dont have seg lab tomorrow right true
excellent thank you
excellent short day
hahaha oooops has lucia said anything about the next assignment
hmm there should be two more weve only 35 weeks left woohoo
your not excited to be done class for the semester youre thats why im excited
do we have a ceg quiz tomorrow
not at this second im on the bus
when im reunited with it allie sent a photo allie sent a photo
clear enough no problem
when is your seg group presenting
my group didnt realize were presenting this friday
right
thanks
im moving friday morning so i wont be in seg can you let me know if the prof days anything important says
thank yoy i will
i have no idea
ah ok sorry i was working on my c project
my partner still isnt answering me the professor is giving him til wednesday at 7pm to respond super frustrating
ya if he doesnt intend to do anything he should just tell me jerk is this where you signed up for your 2110 group
allie sent a photo
thank you allie sent an attachment
i have no idea i hadnt considered that maybe he just means all tasks i thought maybe he meant he wanted tasks to be divided into categories like kitchen bathroom
i made a functional app on my own it doesnt meet all the requirements
but i spent way too much time on it hopefully someone else in my group will finish it its not fair
its a four person group and i made the whole app
oh i did
and i said i needed help and they didnt do anything
is it do tonight
i tried to check but i cant get on brightspace
do you think it would be a good idea to email miguel and say just so you know i did this amount of work and i feel its way more than a quarter of the work and i just cant devote anymore time to it
you cant access it either
oh you can annoying i checked earlier in the week and there was no submission thing yet so i figured it wasnt
oh i got in i guess its uozone i cant get into
ya is it not there
uhohhhhh wonder what happened there maybe i can replicate it on my lenovo i wish we knew how much each lab was worth
very mysterious at least for this lab report i think a lot of the content is already covered in the prelab
we probably need them i think it might take too long to replicate the circuit let me take a look
ok if you dont mind
ok thank you
thanks
okkkkk
thank you i guess we dont even need very many screen shots
ahahahah ooopsies sorry about tht that thanks for going to get the pictures
excellent
yup
have fun
i dont think im going to study for it
im goinf to write it gonna wing it i think its just the software stuff
easy enough
whats the second part
nope
maybe ill do a small study
thank you
ya
sounds good thanks do you know if the last csi2110 lecture is a review session
probably not worth going either way
hi frank
do you happen to know if the format for the ceg final is the same as the sample final posted
i guess its a mystery
i dont want to study for anything
are you looking forward to no school next semester i would be
excellent
im sure you will be just as smart with lots to learn itll be a good time
well thats good news
probably not
databases discrete structures programming paradigms analysis of experimental designs i will probably enjoy discrete structures but anyway i should get back to studying happy studies
sounds like a good idea from the look of the sample exam the earlier material isnt included too much
ignore the rest
nope i got 20 on deliverable 4 for seg isnt that great so i wasted a bunch of time emailing the ta
yup
mhmm and its great that the prof doesnt care oh well
ya ill be sure to never work with them again guess thats all i can do
ya the frustrating part is the time i put into it took a lot of time away from other courses
true
ya stupid project
i dont know why we got such a low mark met at least 70 of the requirments its fully functional i cant make it crash
mhmm
felipe marked it he claims it crashes for him i have been unable to make it crash so who knows
maybe if my team mates had tried running it on their laptops we would have know this still seems like a lot of points to lose this is not meant to be a course in android
ya i guess thats the shittiest part makes me feel like i dont know what im doing you know and i feel like generally im pretty confident in my ability to program
and i hate that they say this was meant to simulate work in the industry in the industry all my team mates would be fired and i would not work for a company that hired such people
hahaa im more pissed at the injustice than the loss of marks and the waste of tiem
ya i think this time next year woohoooo
sure does ottawau treats its students quite poorly i wonder if its like that everywhere
that is certainly true people suck everywhere ok now for real back to wtudying studying thank you for letting me rant
ugh i hate that mantissa stuff thank yoy
you too
hehehe ya i got an a as well apparently my mark on the exam was somehow an a they must have done a lot of bell curving i found that exam brutal hows coop
ill bet i was so sick of school after last semester
oh good must have been nice to actually work on something meaningful
hmmm there might be parking on the side streets off of cumberland i know ive parked on one of them before
i would imagine it is not free nothing is free at ottawau
the st patricks one
there might be free parking for church goers you  old pretend to be going to churchm could
oh maybe its called st joes whatever do it
ya i think my grandmother used to serve food there maybe you can get some food while youre at it
niceeeee i like when that happens
well at least it was fancy hows work going this week oops i just gave myself a thumbs down on one of my messages apparently
whatttttt how
i do suppose that makes sense i guess for me in my job generally the applications i work on im the only one working on them so i could use allie language to plan them really
my roommate is supposed to be doing his honours project under him and miguel keeps not showing up to their meetings
and so he changed the mark
well i woildnt say it turned out nicely
mmm yes i think so
oh yes i n ow know but its shitty that the other students werent penalised theyre going to go into the work place and bring it down
one can hope
i also came very close to losing 1000 from ottawau because of them
if i hasnt fought to have that project mark raised which they all benefitted from we wouuld have had an f on the project and i would have had an a in the course and not gotten the merit scholarship this semestser
and given that ive been in school forever i can really use that money
ya
actuallt maybe we would have had a b ya shitty people are everywhere on the plus side this semester seems pretty chill
mhmm
ys
i tired to take a course at carleton but it turned out that was going to cost a bunch more no i dropped coop im going to do school in the summer
ya part time
mhmm
oh i will
ya i didnt work first year
but its ok i dont think it will take long to pay off mmm 13 000 i believe
well i think i should be able to graduate next december
this year
i hope i want to graduate before my 30th birthday hahaha
im 28
ya so ill be 30 end of september 2019
it doesnt really feel like much ya
ya i guess
i dont really dwell on it i feel lucky that i found computer science it was not something i knew anything about until i decided to do this degree
my high school didnt even have a computers class nah i have two sisters one of them is married with two kids so theres not any pressure
i dont think there really woild be anyway
ya
its good for that i have also gotten to see my sister with her kids and realise how much work they are and how its maybe something i dont want
thats fair i think i would just like to have a lot of dogs im going to adopt a lot of old dogs and make their last months or years as full as love as possible
i just think dogs are the greatest  my family dog is dying weve had him since i was 13
it sucks but hes been so loved and there are so many dogs out there who have never known love and it would be so nice to give them some love
although i do suppose there are a lot of human children in need of love as well in any case id like to adopt a pup for my 30th birthday
ya they need a lot of love too
i suppose thats somewhat true are you on an 8 month work term or will you be in school this summer
oh niceeeee you will have so much good sushi i love sushi where will you be working
for which company
oooh that sounds super interesting
i hope you get it
good idea
have  good sleep
and weekend thank you im sure hes doesnt either hes an old man
yup
3104 31313140 and a math class
all of them are csi what do you need pi ear algebra for
is it a prerequisite for one of your courses
gotcha i took linear algebra in 2009
i have to take the 2000 level one in the fall it was a prereq for at least one of my courses last semester it was fine
ya for a math course
it was alright just googled things
did you go to class yesteday
oh
i had 3104 and 3140 yesteday which one are you dropping
no fun
probably why do you have to take electives when you already have a degree
maybe or maybe because your past degree wasnt at ottawau
everything at ottawau seems to depend on who you ask
every person i speak to at ottawau seems to say something different i had to tell them what courses i need anyway 2 semesters left woohooo
yup 7 courses
gotta graduate before i kill someone find a job in central ottawa thats the dream
i hope not there arent that many companies down town though i hate busing to kanata
ya i will i have friends who work at shopify and klipfolio they seem to like their jobs i suck at interviews
hehehe gotta work on my selfconfidence
are you a tough interviewer when is your next work term
and youre going to japan was it japan
excitinggg
is that so maybe you could create your own form of therapy
hehehe this is true its so strange that some people have the career motivational speaker
perhaps when do you think i should start applying for jobs for january
monday i believe
boooooo
ya we were a good team hi frank do you think we have operating system class today the prof didnt really mention it
ya i know i definitely have lecture in my other monday class im also supposes to have os lab today
this is true
i havent looked at it yet
hehehe sorry i a have two other assignments i have to get done first
thanks you too hahaha hopefully i will
i wish he had made it due friday instead
ya good profs are hard to come by apparently i had the absolute worst prod for databases last semester
ya
ive only taken 1 i wont take 2 sounds like the prof teaching in the fall is awful i just have algorithms left in the fall and math courses
want outtttr
ya i found databases quite interesting but a bad prof is just so hard to deal with
there is but he wouldnt let me see my midterm i finally got to see it after the final exam and he hasnt even marked it
couldnt tell me why he took marks off thats ridiculous
i just dont knism know ottawau is crap
ohhh yaaa dont drop out im sure youll be glad you persevered when youre done i wish ottawau would give me money
i have osap
it was much lower this semester for some reason and my tuition went up a thousand
and i havent received the merit scholarship for some reason were you able to get osap during your work term were
my roommate says he gets grants during the work terms even
i dont know how uhoh
its a mystery
niceee
i think theres probably a cap per year
because i received 4000 in the fall and winter a limit to the amount i grants theyll give you per year
could be only one more month of classes woohoo
then a whole month off so nice
i went to london in 2013 where are you going to go
nice it was fun went to a broadway went too all the touristy places
mmm not really we didnt go outside of london
went on the london eye
my parents were living in saudi arabia so my younger sister and i went and met them in london
big ben went to tower of london
you can now call each other and see information like active status and when youve read messages hi frank thats great could you please describe in a few sentences the type of work youve done with unity
ok that sounds great im the cto and cofounder of cannyvision we are developing immersive virtual reality environments for training purposes with our initial market being public speaking training
we are an early stage startup currently located at the innovation center here in ottawa
ohhhh no way haha i didnt recognize you sorry
hahaha yeah were still with it we are currently participating in startup garage and we are looking for help with the unity aspect of things since were using it for some of the development
as we are limited with funds we are willing to offer our first couple of employees equity instead of money until we get more funds and can afford paying salaries
right now unfortunately not but like i mentioned we are looking to build a core team that would get equity and in the future potentially take an executive role in the company
we are looking into potential angel investors and partners
yes and we started with startup garage a couple of weeks ago
well if youd like i think itd be best for us to meet up and discuss everything and yeah also get to know each other a bit more
ohh ok so maybe skype i guess
great whats your schedule like
ok cool ill check my schedule and let you know later today ok
elad ó° hi sorry for not getting back to you yesterday it was a pretty hectic day are you available today at 6 for skype
elad ó°
nope ill be home in a bit so ill add you
added you
yeah but you wont be able to test it i think maybe from within unity do you have a galaxy phone
yeah thats all you nees need
hmm weird ill look into it
ill look it up you can definitely develop without a headset obviously just not sure about the testing
yeah theyre good to start with
yeah its not great thats why i wish you were here in ottawa but ill try to get my hands on another headset and a phone
and a phone yeah like galaxy s6 or s7
well it requires a phone as well not just the headset so yeah well see if we could work something out
yeah that could definitely be a plan or if we can get another pair well just deliver it to you
elad ó°
yes i just talked to my cofounder as well and really it might not be productive to let you do vr development before we can provide you with hardware to test it on
would you be available for a phone call at 230
we can do a normal phone call
ohh ok no problem do you have limited minutes for incoming calls
ok so sure well do skype
no problem hi frank how are you hope youre feeling better i just wanted to get a quick update before the weekend  did you have a chance to look at the speech recognition options
ok next week then have a good one
yeah sure that sounds like a good plan
ok ill check it out thanks
hi yeah for sure wed love to have you on board full time
yeah we believe wed be able to get ourselves funded
thats ok but yeah were not sure yet
haha yeah its not easy but hard work pays off
yeah and we just want to make sure we figure everything out so no work would go to waste
we are still working on it but youre coming back to ottawa in september no
oh ok let me know maybe we could meet up
hi frank i hope youre doing good  as the startup garage program is coming to an end i just wanted to say that we will only be working parttime on cannyvision starting september   we recently decided to pivot and focus on corporate training in vr and ai rather than just focusing on public speaking   i would be happy to stay in touch with you when you come back to ottawa since it would be more efficient to work together when youre physically here  also we are still looking to raise funds so we could get you as a coop student for the winter
hi frank like i said we will be working on it part time so unfortunately our resources are currently limited in terms of capital that being said i think its best for you to find another job through coop
also since its part time and we recently pivoted we need to do some business dev work before we dive into coding again so ill be happy to get back to you when that happens
haha it is but if it wasnt  everybody could have made it and become successful ceos you have to work hard good luck this semester and with your coop job searching well be in touch soon
